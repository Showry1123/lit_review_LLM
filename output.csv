Stroke Epidemiology and Risk Factor Management.,"Guzik A, Bushnell C.",10.1212/CON.0000000000000416,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Death from stroke has decreased over the past decade, with  stroke now the fifth leading cause of death in the United States. In addition,  the incidence of new and recurrent stroke is declining, likely because of the  increased use of specific prevention medications, such as statins and  antihypertensives. Despite these positive trends in incidence and mortality,  many strokes remain preventable. The major modifiable risk factors are  hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco smoking, and hyperlipidemia, as well as  lifestyle factors, such as obesity, poor diet/nutrition, and physical  inactivity. This article reviews the current recommendations for the management  of each of these modifiable risk factors. RECENT FINDINGS: It has been documented that some blood pressure medications may  increase variability of blood pressure and ultimately increase the risk for  stroke. Stroke prevention typically includes antiplatelet therapy (unless an  indication for anticoagulation exists), so the most recent evidence supporting  use of these drugs is reviewed. In addition, emerging risk factors, such as  obstructive sleep apnea, electronic cigarettes, and elevated lipoprotein (a),  are discussed. SUMMARY: Overall, secondary stroke prevention includes a multifactorial  approach. This article incorporates evidence from guidelines and published  studies and uses an illustrative case study throughout the article to provide  examples of secondary prevention management of stroke risk factors.",Review of secondary stroke prevention.
Effects of e-cigarettes and vaping devices on cardiac and pulmonary physiology.,"Tsai M(1), Byun MK(2)(3)(4), Shin J(2)(3), Crotty Alexander LE(2)(3).",10.1113/JP279754,"E-cigarette aerosols are exceedingly different from conventional tobacco smoke,  containing dozens of chemicals not found in cigarette smoke. It is highly likely  that chronic use of e-cigarettes will induce pathological changes in both the  heart and lungs. Here we review human and animal studies published to date and  summarize the cardiopulmonary physiological changes caused by vaping. In terms  of cardiac physiology, acute exposure to e-cigarette aerosols in human subjects  led to increased blood pressure and heart rate, similar to traditional  cigarettes. Chronic exposure to e-cigarette aerosols using animal models caused  increased arterial stiffness, vascular endothelial changes, increased  angiogenesis, cardiorenal fibrosis and increased atherosclerotic plaque  formation. Pulmonary physiology is also affected by e-cigarette aerosol  inhalation, with increased airway reactivity, airway obstruction, inflammation  and emphysema. Research thus far demonstrates that the heart and lung undergo  numerous changes in response to e-cigarette use, and disease development will  depend on how those changes combine with both environmental and genetic factors.  E-cigarettes have been advertised as a healthy alternative to cigarette smoking,  and users are under the impression that vaping of e-cigarettes is harmless, but  these claims that e-cigarettes are safer and healthier are not based on  evidence. Data from both humans and animal models are consistent in  demonstrating that vaping of e-cigarettes causes health effects both similar to  and disparate from those of cigarette smoking. Further work is needed to define  the long-term cardiopulmonary effects of e-cigarette use in humans.",Review of human and animal studies
Electronic cigarettes: human health effects.,Callahan-Lyon P.,10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2013-051470,"OBJECTIVE: With the rapid increase in use of electronic nicotine delivery  systems (ENDS), such as electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes), users and  non-users are exposed to the aerosol and product constituents. This is a review  of published data on the human health effects of exposure to e-cigarettes and  their components. METHODS: Literature searches were conducted through September 2013 using  multiple electronic databases. RESULTS: Forty-four articles are included in this analysis. E-cigarette aerosols  may contain propylene glycol, glycerol, flavourings, other chemicals and,  usually, nicotine. Aerosolised propylene glycol and glycerol produce mouth and  throat irritation and dry cough. No data on the effects of flavouring inhalation  were identified. Data on short-term health effects are limited and there are no  adequate data on long-term effects. Aerosol exposure may be associated with  respiratory function impairment, and serum cotinine levels are similar to those  in traditional cigarette smokers. The high nicotine concentrations of some  products increase exposure risks for non-users, particularly children. The  dangers of secondhand and thirdhand aerosol exposure have not been thoroughly  evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: Scientific evidence regarding the human health effects of  e-cigarettes is limited. While e-cigarette aerosol may contain fewer toxicants  than cigarette smoke, studies evaluating whether e-cigarettes are less harmful  than cigarettes are inconclusive. Some evidence suggests that e-cigarette use  may facilitate smoking cessation, but definitive data are lacking. No  e-cigarette has been approved by FDA as a cessation aid. Environmental concerns  and issues regarding non-user exposure exist. The health impact of e-cigarettes,  for users and the public, cannot be determined with currently available data.",Literature review on e-cigaret
Heat-not-burn tobacco products: an emerging threat to cardiovascular health.,"Fried ND(1), Gardner JD(1).",10.1152/ajpheart.00708.2020,"Cigarette smoking is at all-time lows globally, but the use of electronic  cigarettes has increased profoundly. Recent reports of electronic cigarette or  vaping use-associated lung injury may lead individuals to explore novel methods  of nicotine consumption, such as heat-not-burn devices. IQOS from Philip Morris,  a heat-not-burn device, became available for purchase in the United States in  October 2019. Philip Morris claims that 8.8 million people have abandoned  traditional cigarettes in favor of IQOS; however, evidence suggests that it may  act as a gateway or complement to cigarette smoking, rather than a replacement.  Surveys indicate that 96% of Korean IQOS users also smoke cigarettes, and 45% of  Italian users of IQOS had never smoked cigarettes. In the United States, Canada,  and England, susceptibility of youth to trying IQOS was slightly lower than  electronic cigarettes, but higher than cigarette smoking. Heat-not-burn products  produce mainstream and second-hand emissions of harmful chemicals, including  nicotine, particulate matter, benzene, acrolein, and tobacco-specific  nitrosamines. The levels of these emissions, despite being less than those of  traditional cigarettes, are potentially harmful to cardiovascular health. A  study of current smokers showed similar acute effects of heat-not-burn tobacco  products and traditional cigarettes on heart rate, blood pressure, and arterial  stiffness. Rats exposed to IQOS had similar vascular endothelial function  impairment to those exposed to cigarettes. Heat-not-burn aerosol exposure of  cultured macrophages elicited increased oxidative stress, although less than  that induced by cigarette smoke. Further studies are needed to better understand  the cardiovascular effects of heat-not-burn tobacco products.",Observational study on heat-not
"Health effects of electronic cigarette (e‑cigarette) use on organ systems and 
its implications for public health.","Seiler-Ramadas R(1), Sandner I(2), Haider S(2), Grabovac I(2), Dorner TE(2).",10.1007/s00508-020-01711-z,"BACKGROUND: There has been growing concern over the use of electronic cigarettes  (e-cigarettes) in recent years. Although advocated as an aid to smoking  cessation, there is increasing evidence of harm not just to the respiratory  system, but to all other organs in the body. To give a clearer picture on how  e‑cigarettes can affect our health, we gathered an overview of the literature on  the various health effects of e‑cigarettes and categorized them into how they  specifically affect organ systems. E‑cigarette exposure has produced a range of  stress and inflammatory reactions in the pulmonary system, including shortness  of breath, coughing, wheezing, bronchial and pulmonary irritations, and impaired  pulmonary function. In the oral and gastrointestinal system, gingival  inflammation, sore throat, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea have been reported.  Increased tachycardia and blood pressure were reported reactions in the  cardiovascular system. In the neurological system headaches, irritability,  anxiety, dependence and insomnia were observed. Other effects included ocular  irritation, contact dermatitis, acute renal insufficiency, toxicity and  potential carcinogenicity. Nevertheless, studies have found improvements in  time-based memory and nicotine withdrawal associated with the cessation of  conventional cigarette smoking and switching to e‑cigarette use. Also, toxic and  carcinogenic metabolites were reportedly lower in e‑cigarette smokers than in  conventional cigarette smokers. CONCLUSION: A growing number of studies are showing the adverse effects caused  by e‑cigarettes on all human organ systems. Further research on the chemical  components, the diverse flavors, and the long-term effects on active and passive  users are needed to clarify the implications of e‑cigarette use on individual  and public health.",Literature review on e-cigaret

This hygroscopic/hyperosmolar aerosol can deposit  deep within the lung. Whether these deposits trigger local inflammation and  disturb pulmonary gas exchanges is not known. The aim of this study was to  assess the acute effects of high-wattage electronic cigarette vaping with or  without nicotine on lung inflammation biomarkers, transcutaneous gas tensions,  and pulmonary function tests in young and healthy tobacco smokers. Acute effects  of vaping without nicotine on arterial blood gas tensions were also assessed in  heavy smokers suspected of coronary artery disease. Using a single-blind  within-subjects study design, 25 young tobacco smokers underwent three  experimental sessions in random order: sham-vaping and vaping with and without  nicotine at 60 W. Twenty heavy smokers were also exposed to sham-vaping (n = 10)  or vaping without nicotine (n = 10) in an open-label, randomized parallel study.  In the young tobacco smokers, compared with sham-vaping: 1) serum club cell  protein-16 increased after vaping without nicotine (mean ± SE, -0.5 ± 0.2 vs.  +1.1 ± 0.3 µg/l, P = 0.013) and vaping with nicotine (+1.2 ± 0.3 µg/l, P =  0.009); 2) transcutaneous oxygen tension decreased for 60 min after vaping  without nicotine (nadir, -0.3 ± 1 vs. -15.3 ± 2.3 mmHg, P < 0.001) and for  80-min after vaping with nicotine (nadir, -19.6 ± 2.8 mmHg, P < 0.001). Compared  with sham vaping, vaping without nicotine decreased arterial oxygen tension for  5 min in heavy-smoking patients (+5.4 ± 3.3 vs. -5.4 ± 1.9 mmHg, P = 0.012).  Acute vaping of propylene glycol/glycerol aerosol at high wattage with or  without nicotine induces airway epithelial injury and sustained decrement in  transcutaneous oxygen tension in young tobacco smokers. Intense vaping  conditions also transiently impair arterial oxygen tension in heavy smokers.","Experimental, randomized, single-blind"
"E-cigarette, or vaping, product use associated lung injury (EVALI): case series 
and diagnostic approach.","Kalininskiy A(1), Bach CT(2), Nacca NE(3), Ginsberg G(4), Marraffa J(5), 
Navarette KA(6), McGraw MD(7), Croft DP(2).",10.1016/S2213-2600(19)30415-1,"BACKGROUND: Since June, 2019, more than 1000 new cases of e-cigarette, or  vaping, product use associated lung injury (EVALI) have been reported in the  USA. Patients presented with dyspnoea, cough, and were found to be hypoxaemic  with bilateral airspace opacities on chest imaging. Most patients required  management in the intensive care unit and steroid therapy. All patients  recovered with cessation of vaping, supportive care, and steroid therapy and  remained symptom free at follow up. E-cigarette use continues to rapidly  escalate in the USA, particularly among youth. METHODS: Cases were defined as patients admitted to the University of Rochester  Medical Center (Rochester, NY, USA) who had used e-cigarettes or another vaping  device in the 30 days before presentation, and who had bilateral airspace  opacification on chest imaging (CT or x-ray). Case details were obtained via  medical record review and patient interviews over the past 3 months including  symptomatology, physical exam data, imaging studies, laboratory data, vaping  history, and subsequent outpatient follow-up data. In collaboration with the New  York State Department of Health, our hospital developed a novel clinical  practice algorithm based on statewide physician feedback along with input from  experts in environmental health, medical toxicology, infectious disease,  epidemiology, and chronic disease prevention. FINDINGS: We report 12 cases treated for suspected EVALI at our medical centre  between June 6, 2019, and Sept 15, 2019. Ten (83%) patients had dyspnoea, fever,  and emesis and nine (75%) had cough. 11 (92%) patients reported the use of  e-cigarette cartridges containing tetrahydrocannabinol oil. Although eight (67%)  patients required admission to the intensive care unit for hypoxaemic  respiratory failure, no deaths occurred. The median hospitalisation duration was  7 days (IQR 7-8). All patients completing follow up (6 [50%]) had resolution of  previous chest CT findings and normal spirometry. The clinical algorithm focuses  on the key signs and symptoms of EVALI and the importance of ruling out  infection and other cardiopulmonary conditions before making a presumptive  diagnosis of EVALI. INTERPRETATION: Patients with suspected EVALI in our cohort had life-threatening  hypoxaemia, with 67% requiring management in the intensive care unit. Despite  the severity of presentation, similar to previous reports of patients with  EVALI, most patients improved within 1-2 weeks of initial presentation after  vaping cessation and administration of systemic corticosteroids when needed.  Almost all (92%) patients with suspected EVALI reported vaping a THC product,  making THC containing e-liquids or oils a key focus on the ongoing nationwide  investigations into the cause of EVALI. Additional research is required to  understand the potential toxins, underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, and  identification of susceptible individuals at higher risk for hospitalisation due  to EVALI. To our knowledge we present the first clinical practice algorithm for  the evaluation and management of EVALI, which will be useful for both acute  management and improved accurate reporting of this life-threatening respiratory  illness.

We hypothesized that e-cigarette use  causes changes in blood milieu that impair endothelial function. METHODS: Endothelial function was measured in chronic e-cigarette users, chronic  cigarette smokers, and nonusers. We measured effects of participants' sera, or  e-cigarette aerosol condensate, on NO and H2O2 release and cell permeability in  cultured endothelial cells (ECs). RESULTS: E-cigarette users and smokers had lower flow-mediated dilation (FMD)  than nonusers. Sera from e-cigarette users and smokers reduced VEGF (vascular  endothelial growth factor)-induced NO secretion by ECs relative to nonuser sera,  without significant reduction in endothelial NO synthase mRNA or protein levels.  E-cigarette user sera caused increased endothelial release of H2O2, and more  permeability than nonuser sera. E-cigarette users and smokers exhibited changes  in circulating biomarkers of inflammation, thrombosis, and cell adhesion  relative to nonusers, but with distinct profiles. E-cigarette user sera had  higher concentrations of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE)  ligands S100A8 and HMGB1 (high mobility group box 1) than smoker and nonuser  sera, and receptor for advanced glycation end product inhibition reduced  permeability induced by e-cigarette user sera but did not affect NO production. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic vaping and smoking both impair FMD and cause changes in the  blood that inhibit endothelial NO release. Vaping, but not smoking, causes  changes in the blood that increase microvascular endothelial permeability and  may have a vaping-specific effect on intracellular oxidative state. Our results  suggest a role for RAGE in e-cigarette-induced changes in endothelial function.",Observational study on endothelial

Conducting Airways.","Antoniewicz L(1), Brynedal A(2), Hedman L(3)(4), Lundbäck M(5), Bosson JA(2).",10.1007/s12012-019-09516-x,"The use of electronic cigarettes has increased exponentially since its  introduction onto the global market in 2006. However, short- and long-term  health effects remain largely unknown due to the novelty of this product. The  present study examines the acute effects of e-cigarette aerosol inhalation, with  and without nicotine, on vascular and pulmonary function in healthy volunteers.  Seventeen healthy subjects inhaled electronic cigarette aerosol with and without  nicotine on two separate occasions in a double-blinded crossover fashion. Blood  pressure, heart rate, and arterial stiffness measured by pulse wave velocity and  pulse wave analysis were assessed at baseline, and then at 0 h, 2 h, and 4 h  following exposure. Dynamic spirometry and impulse oscillometry were measured  following vascular assessments at these time points, as well as at 6 h following  exposure. e-Cigarette aerosol with nicotine caused a significant increase in  heart rate and arterial stiffness. Furthermore, e-cigarette aerosol-containing  nicotine caused a sudden increase in flow resistance as measured by impulse  oscillometry, indicating obstruction of the conducting airways. Both aerosols  caused an increase in blood pressure. The present study indicates that inhaled  e-cigarette aerosol with nicotine has an acute impact on vascular and pulmonary  function. Thus, chronic usage may lead to long-term adverse health effects.  Further investigation is warranted.",Acute effects of e-cigarettes
Are vaporizers a lower-risk alternative to smoking cannabis?,"Chaiton M(1)(2)(3), Kundu A(4), Rueda S(5)(6)(7), Di Ciano P(5)(6)(8).",10.17269/s41997-021-00565-w,"Publisher: RéSUMé: L’usage du cannabis est associé à une panoplie de résultats  de santé physique et mentale indésirables et à un risque accru de collision  entre véhicules automobiles.

Notre commentaire attire l’attention sur les  preuves actuelles concernant le potentiel de réduction des méfaits du vapotage  du cannabis. L’utilisation d’un vaporisateur de cannabis peut réduire l’émission  de monoxyde de carbone, les symptômes respiratoires chroniques et l’exposition à  plusieurs toxines tout en produisant des effets subjectifs et une concentration  de THC dans le sang semblables à ceux du cannabis fumé, ce qui pourrait réduire  les méfaits chez les fumeurs réguliers de cannabis. Par contre, les nouveaux  consommateurs de cannabis, peu importe la méthode d’administration du cannabis  choisie, peuvent éprouver des effets subjectifs intenses et une détérioration  cognitive, ainsi qu’une susceptibilité accrue à la dépendance.

Some people who smoke  use ECs to stop or reduce smoking, but some organizations, advocacy groups and  policymakers have discouraged this, citing lack of evidence of efficacy and  safety. People who smoke, healthcare providers and regulators want to know if  ECs can help people quit and if they are safe to use for this purpose. This is  an update conducted as part of a living systematic review. OBJECTIVES: To examine the effectiveness, tolerability, and safety of using  electronic cigarettes (ECs) to help people who smoke tobacco achieve long-term  smoking abstinence. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's Specialized  Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE,  Embase, and PsycINFO to 1 May 2021, and reference-checked and contacted study  authors. We screened abstracts from the Society for Research on Nicotine and  Tobacco (SRNT) 2021 Annual Meeting.   SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized  controlled trials (RCTs) and randomized cross-over trials, in which people who  smoke were randomized to an EC or control condition. We also included  uncontrolled intervention studies in which all participants received an EC  intervention. Studies had to report abstinence from cigarettes at six months or  longer or data on safety markers at one week or longer, or both. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We followed standard Cochrane methods for  screening and data extraction. Our primary outcome measures were abstinence from  smoking after at least six months follow-up, adverse events (AEs), and serious  adverse events (SAEs). Secondary outcomes included the proportion of people  still using study product (EC or pharmacotherapy) at six or more months after  randomization or starting EC use, changes in carbon monoxide (CO), blood  pressure (BP), heart rate, arterial oxygen saturation, lung function, and levels  of carcinogens or toxicants or both. We used a fixed-effect Mantel-Haenszel  model to calculate risk ratios (RRs) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) for  dichotomous outcomes. For continuous outcomes, we calculated mean differences.  Where appropriate, we pooled data in meta-analyses. MAIN RESULTS: We included 61 completed studies, representing 16,759  participants, of which 34 were RCTs. Five of the 61 included studies were new to  this review update. Of the included studies, we rated seven (all contributing to  our main comparisons) at low risk of bias overall, 42 at high risk overall  (including all non-randomized studies), and the remainder at unclear risk. There  was moderate-certainty evidence, limited by imprecision, that quit rates were  higher in people randomized to nicotine EC than in those randomized to nicotine  replacement therapy (NRT) (risk ratio (RR) 1.53, 95% confidence interval (CI)  1.21 to 1.93; I2 = 0%; 4 studies, 1924 participants). In absolute terms, this  might translate to an additional three quitters per 100 (95% CI 1 to 6). There  was low-certainty evidence (limited by very serious imprecision) that the rate  of occurrence of AEs was similar (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.19; I2 = 0%; 2  studies, 485 participants). SAEs were rare, but there was insufficient evidence  to determine whether rates differed between groups due to very serious  imprecision (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.90: I2 = 0; 4 studies, 1424  participants). There was moderate-certainty evidence, again limited by  imprecision, that quit rates were higher in people randomized to nicotine EC  than to non-nicotine EC (RR 1.94, 95% CI 1.21 to 3.13; I2 = 0%; 5 studies, 1447  participants). In absolute terms, this might lead to an additional seven  quitters per 100 (95% CI 2 to 16). There was moderate-certainty evidence of no  difference in the rate of AEs between these groups (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.91 to  1.11; I2 = 0%; 3 studies, 601 participants). There was insufficient evidence to  determine whether rates of SAEs differed between groups, due to very serious  imprecision (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.38; I2 = 0; 5 studies, 792 participants).  Compared to behavioural support only/no support, quit rates were higher for  participants randomized to nicotine EC (RR 2.61, 95% CI 1.44 to 4.74; I2 = 0%; 6  studies, 2886 participants). In absolute terms this represents an additional six  quitters per 100 (95% CI 2 to 15). However, this finding was of very low  certainty, due to issues with imprecision and risk of bias. There was some  evidence that non-serious AEs were more common in people randomized to nicotine  EC (RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.32; I2 = 41%, low certainty; 4 studies, 765  participants), and again, insufficient evidence to determine whether rates of  SAEs differed between groups (RR 1.51, 95% CI 0.70 to 3.24; I2 = 0%; 7 studies,  1303 participants).  Data from non-randomized studies were consistent with RCT  data. The most commonly reported AEs were throat/mouth irritation, headache,  cough, and nausea, which tended to dissipate with continued use. Very few  studies reported data on other outcomes or comparisons, hence evidence for these  is limited, with CIs often encompassing clinically significant harm and benefit. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is moderate-certainty evidence that ECs with  nicotine increase quit rates compared to NRT and compared to ECs without  nicotine. Evidence comparing nicotine EC with usual care/no treatment also  suggests benefit, but is less certain. More studies are needed to confirm the  effect size. Confidence intervals were for the most part wide for data on AEs,  SAEs and other safety markers, with no difference in AEs between nicotine and  non-nicotine ECs. Overall incidence of SAEs was low across all study arms. We  did not detect  evidence of harm from nicotine EC, but longest follow-up was two  years and the  number of studies was small. The main limitation of the evidence  base remains imprecision due to the small number of RCTs, often with low event  rates, but further RCTs are underway. To ensure the review continues to provide  up-to-date information to decision-makers, this review is now a living  systematic review. We run searches monthly, with the review updated when  relevant new evidence becomes available.

We assessed the acute effects of TC, EC and sham smoking  on blood pressure, heart rate and sympathetic nervous system. Methods: We  studied 12 normotensive male habitual smokers (mean age 33 years) free of  cardiovascular disease. The study design was randomized and sham controlled with  three experimental sessions (sham smoking, TC smoking and EC smoking). After  baseline measurements at rest, the subjects were then asked to smoke (puffing  habits left uncontrolled) two TC cigarettes containing 1.1 mg nicotine, EC  smoking or simulated smoking with a drinking straw with a filter (sham smoking),  in line with previous methodology. Results: EC smoking at 5 and 30 min compared  to baseline was accompanied by the augmentation of mean arterial pressure (MAP)  and heart rate (p < 0.001 for all). The muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA)  decrease was significant during both TC and EC sessions (p < 0.001 for both  comparisons) and was similar between them (−25.1% ± 9.8% vs. −34.4% ± 8.3%,  respectively, p = 0.018). Both MSNA decreases were significantly higher (p <  0.001 for both comparisons) than that elicited by sham smoking (−4.4% ± 4.8%).  Skin sympathetic nerve activity increase was significant in both TC and EC  groups (p < 0.001 for both comparisons) and similar between them (73.4% ± 17.9%  and 71.9% ± 7%, respectively, p = 0.829).

There was low-certainty evidence (limited by very serious  imprecision) that the rate of occurrence of AEs was similar) (RR 0.98, 95% CI  0.80 to 1.19; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 485 participants). SAEs occurred rarely, with  no evidence that their frequency differed between nicotine EC and NRT, but very  serious imprecision led to low certainty in this finding (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.77  to 2.41: I2 = n/a; 2 studies, 727 participants). There was moderate-certainty  evidence, again limited by imprecision, that quit rates were higher in people  randomized to nicotine EC than to non-nicotine EC (RR 1.70, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.81;  I2 = 0%; 4 studies, 1057 participants). In absolute terms, this might again lead  to an additional four successful quitters per 100 (95% CI 0 to 11). These trials  mainly used older EC with relatively low nicotine delivery. There was  moderate-certainty evidence of no difference in the rate of AEs between these  groups (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.11; I2 = 0%; 3 studies, 601 participants).  There was insufficient evidence to determine whether rates of SAEs differed  between groups, due to very serious imprecision (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.44;  I2 = n/a; 4 studies, 494 participants). Compared to behavioral support only/no  support, quit rates were higher for participants randomized to nicotine EC (RR  2.70, 95% CI 1.39 to 5.26; I2 = 0%; 5 studies, 2561 participants). In absolute  terms this represents an increase of seven per 100 (95% CI 2 to 17). However,  this finding was of very low certainty, due to issues with imprecision and risk  of bias. There was no evidence that the rate of SAEs differed, but some evidence  that non-serious AEs were more common in people randomized to nicotine EC (AEs:  RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.32; I2 = 41%, low certainty; 4 studies, 765  participants; SAEs: RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.33 to 4.09; I2 = 5%; 6 studies, 1011  participants, very low certainty). Data from non-randomized studies were  consistent with RCT data. The most commonly reported AEs were throat/mouth  irritation, headache, cough, and nausea, which tended to dissipate with  continued use. Very few studies reported data on other outcomes or comparisons  and hence evidence for these is limited, with confidence intervals often  encompassing clinically significant harm and benefit. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is moderate-certainty evidence that ECs with  nicotine increase quit rates compared to ECs without nicotine and compared to  NRT. Evidence comparing nicotine EC with usual care/no treatment also suggests  benefit, but is less certain. More studies are needed to confirm the size of  effect, particularly when using modern EC products. Confidence intervals were  for the most part wide for data on AEs, SAEs and other safety markers, though  evidence indicated no difference in AEs between nicotine and non-nicotine ECs.  Overall incidence of SAEs was low across all study arms. We did not detect any  clear evidence of harm from nicotine EC, but longest follow-up was two years and  the overall number of studies was small. The evidence is limited mainly by  imprecision due to the small number of RCTs, often with low event rates. Further  RCTs are underway. To ensure the review continues to provide up-to-date  information, this review is now a living systematic review. We run searches  monthly, with the review updated when relevant new evidence becomes available.

We systematically reviewed and meta-analysed published literature to investigate  the cardiovascular effects and associated risk from electronic cigarette use. METHODS AND RESULTS: We searched PubMed from January 2000 to November 2017 for  published studies assessing the cardiovascular effects of the electronic  cigarette. Evidence suggests that the electronic cigarette negatively affects  endothelial function, arterial stiffness and the long-term risk for coronary  events, but these findings are from single study reports and have not been  confirmed in additional studies. Conflicting evidence exists on the effects of  the electronic cigarette on heart rate and blood pressure, which is mainly based  on non-randomized clinical studies of moderate quality. The meta-analysis of 14  studies (N + 441 participants) suggested that despite the negative acute effects  of the electronic cigarette on heart rate (pooled mean difference (MD) + 2.27,  95% confidence interval (CI): 1.64 to 2.89, p < 0.001), diastolic (pooled  MD + 2.01 mmHg, 95% CI: 0.62 to 3.39, p + 0.004) and systolic blood pressure  (pooled MD + 2.02 mmHg, 95% CI: 0.07 to 3.97, p + 0.042), benefits may be  observed in terms of blood pressure regulation when switching from tobacco  smoking to chronic electronic cigarette use (systolic blood pressure pooled  MD + -7.00, 95% CI: -9.63 to -4.37, p < 0.001; diastolic blood pressure pooled  MD + -3.65, 95% CI: -5.71 to -1.59, p + 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The existing evidence on the cardiovascular effects of the  electronic cigarette is concerning, with several unexplored issues. Unless  supported by stronger evidence, the electronic cigarette should not be labelled  as a cardiovascular safe product.

The  early cardiovascular effects of switching from tobacco cigarettes (TC) to EC in  chronic smokers is unknown. Meta-analysis of flow-mediated dilation (FMD)  studies indicate 13% lower pooled, adjusted relative risks of cardiovascular  events with every 1% improvement in FMD. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine the early vascular impact of  switching from TC to EC in chronic smokers. METHODS: The authors conducted a prospective, randomized control trial with a  parallel nonrandomized preference cohort and blinded endpoint of smokers ≥18  years of age who had smoked ≥15 cigarettes/day for ≥2 years and were free from  established cardiovascular disease. Participants were randomized to EC with  nicotine or EC without nicotine for 1 month. Those unwilling to quit continued  with TC in a parallel preference arm. A propensity score analysis was done to  adjust for differences between the randomized and preference arms. Vascular  function was assessed by FMD and pulse wave velocity. Compliance with EC was  measured by carbon monoxide levels. RESULTS: Within 1 month of switching from TC to EC, there was a significant  improvement in endothelial function (linear trend β = 0.73%; 95% confidence  interval [CI]: 0.41 to 1.05; p < 0.0001; TC vs. EC combined: 1.49%; 95% CI: 0.93  to 2.04; p < 0.0001) and vascular stiffness (-0.529 m/s; 95% CI: -0.946  to -0.112; p = 0.014). Females benefited from switching more than males did in  every between-group comparison. Those who complied best with EC switch  demonstrated the largest improvement. There was no difference in vascular  effects between EC with and without nicotine within the study timeframe. CONCLUSIONS: TC smokers, particularly females, demonstrate significant  improvement in vascular health within 1 month of switching from TC to EC.  Switching from TC to EC may be considered a harms reduction measure.

There are many types  of e-cigarettes available and the most popular type today in the United States  are 'pod' based devices that use high nicotine concentration liquids.  Understanding the nicotine delivery capabilities of e-cigarettes is imperative  for understanding their addictive potential and safety profile, informing  regulation, and revealing their potential use as smoking cessation aids. Areas  covered: This review discusses nicotine content of e-cigarettes, effectiveness  of nicotine aerosolization by devices, delivery of nicotine to users, and user  and device characteristics that impact each of these. Expert opinion: Modern  e-cigarettes have the potential to deliver equal or more nicotine compared to a  tobacco cigarette. Future research needs to identify the nicotine delivery  profiles likely to benefit public health and the means to regulate them  appropriately while also identifying those that are likely to cause harm. Public  health benefit accrues if e-cigarettes help smokers quit combustible cigarettes  completely. Harm is possible if inadequate nicotine delivery undermines  cessation attempts, e-cigarettes facilitate continued combustible cigarette use,  long-term e-cigarette use is associated with substantial morbidity/mortality,  and/or e-cigarettes increase the initiation of combustible cigarette use among  never smokers.",Review of nicotine delivery in e

We hypothesize that nicotine can also dysregulate brain parenchymal  glucose utilization by altering glucose transporters with effects on sensitivity  to ischemic stroke. In this study, we investigated the effects of nicotine  exposure on neuronal glucose utilization using an in vitro ischemic stroke  model. We also tested the effects of e-Cig vaping on ischemic brain glucose  utilization using an acute brain slice technique. Primary cortical neurons and  brain slices were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation followed by  reoxygenation to mimic ischemia-reperfusion injury. We estimated brain cell  glucose utilization by measuring the uptake of [3 H] deoxy-d-glucose.  Immunofluorescence and western blotting were done to characterize glucose  transporters (GLUTs) and α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) expression.  Furthermore, we used a glycolytic stress test to measure the effects of nicotine  exposure on neuronal glucose metabolism. We observed that short- and long-term  nicotine/cotinine exposure significantly decreased neuronal glucose utilization  in ischemic conditions and the non-specific nAChR antagonist, mecamylamine  reversed this effect. Nicotine/cotinine exposure also decreased neuronal GLUT1  and up-regulated α7 nAChR expression and decreased glycolysis. Exposure of mice  to e-Cig vapor for 7 days likewise decreases brain glucose uptake under normoxic  and ischemic conditions along with down-regulation of GLUT1 and GLUT3  expressions. These data support, from a cerebrovascular perspective, that  nicotine and/or e-Cig vaping induce a state of glucose deprivation at the  neurovascular unit which could lead to enhanced ischemic brain injury and/or  stroke risk.

Here, we investigated whether e-cigarette vapor inhalation alters ACE2  and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) expression in male and female mice.  In male lung, nicotine vapor inhalation induced a significant increase in ACE2  mRNA and protein, but surprisingly, these differences were not found in females.  Further, both vehicle and nicotine vapor inhalation downregulated α5 nAChR  subunits in both sexes, while differences were not found in α7 nAChR subunit  expression. Finally, blood ACE2 levels did not differ with exposure, indicating  that blood sampling is not a sufficient indicator of lung ACE2 changes.  Together, these data indicate a direct link between e-cigarette vaping and  increased ACE2 expression in male lung tissue, which thereby reveals an  underlying mechanism of increased vulnerability to coronavirus infection in  individuals vaping nicotine.",Experimental animal intervention study with hist

This cross-sectional study examined correlations for  multiple measures of adolescent e-cigarette use with nicotine exposure  quantified with salivary cotinine levels. METHODS: Adolescents (N=173, age 13-18) who reported past-month e-cigarette use  were recruited from the San Francisco Bay Area. Participants self-reported: (1)  days of e-cigarette use in a typical month, (2) number of e-cigarette sessions  in a typical day (sessions per day; SPD) and the (3) E-Cigarette Addiction  Severity Index (EASI). Participants also completed the 10-item Penn State  Electronic Cigarette Dependence Index (ECDI), which we examined in full and as a  2-item Heaviness of Vaping Index (HVI; the sum of the ECDI items on use  frequency and time to first vaping on wakening). Sessions per month (SPM) were  calculated using days per month and SPD. Cotinine levels, SPD and SPM were  log-transformed. RESULTS: Among frequency measures, SPM correlated most strongly with cotinine  (r=0.59), followed closely by days per month (r=0.58) and SPD (r=0.57), p<0.001.  Among dependence measures, the EASI correlated most strongly with cotinine  (r=0.51), closely followed by the ECDI and HVI (r's=0.50), all p's<0.001. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents' reports of frequency of e-cigarette use and degree of  addiction correlated significantly with cotinine as a biomarker of nicotine  exposure.

Pairwise comparisons assessed differentially abundant  bacteria species. Total bacterial load was similar between groups, with no  differences in bacterial diversity across lung microbiomes. In lungs, 44  bacteria species differed significantly (FDR < 0.1) between  smokers/never-smokers, with most decreased in smokers.

Electronic cigarettes and nicotine clinical pharmacology.,"Schroeder MJ(1), Hoffman AC.",10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2013-051469,"OBJECTIVE: To review the available literature evaluating electronic cigarette  (e-cigarette) nicotine clinical pharmacology in order to understand the  potential impact of e-cigarettes on individual users, nicotine dependence and  public health. METHODS: Literature searches were conducted between 1 October 2012 and 30  September 2013 using key terms in five electronic databases. Studies were  included in the review if they were in English and publicly available;  non-clinical studies, conference abstracts and studies exclusively measuring  nicotine content in e-cigarette cartridges were excluded from the review. RESULTS: Nicotine yields from automated smoking machines suggest that  e-cigarettes deliver less nicotine per puff than traditional cigarettes, and  clinical studies indicate that e-cigarettes deliver only modest nicotine  concentrations to the inexperienced e-cigarette user. However, current  e-cigarette smokers are able to achieve systemic nicotine and/or cotinine  concentrations similar to those produced from traditional cigarettes. Therefore,  user experience is critically important for nicotine exposure, and may  contribute to the products' ability to support and maintain nicotine dependence. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge about e-cigarette nicotine pharmacology remains limited.  Because a user's e-cigarette experience may significantly impact nicotine  delivery, future nicotine pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies should be  conducted in experienced users to accurately assess the products' impact on  public health.",Literature review on e-cigaret

As all E-cigs use propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin (PG-VG)  and generate abundant saturated aldehydes, mice were exposed by inhalation to  PG-VG-derived aerosol, formaldehyde (FA), acetaldehyde (AA), or filtered air.  Biomarkers of exposure and cardiopulmonary injury were monitored by mass  spectrometry (urine metabolites), radiotelemetry (respiratory reflexes),  isometric myography (aorta), and flow cytometry (blood markers). Acute PG-VG  exposure significantly affected multiple biomarkers including pulmonary reflex  (decreased respiratory rate, -50%), endothelium-dependent relaxation  (-61.8 ± 4.2%), decreased WBC (-47 ± 7%), and, increased RBC (+6 ± 1%) and  hemoglobin (+4 ± 1%) versus air control group. Notably, FA exposure  recapitulated the prominent effects of PG-VG aerosol on pulmonary irritant  reflex and endothelial dysfunction, whereas AA exposure did not. To attempt to  link PG-VG exposure with FA or AA exposure, urinary formate and acetate levels  were measured by GC-MS. Although neither FA nor AA exposure altered excretion of  their primary metabolite, formate or acetate, respectively, compared with  air-exposed controls, PG-VG aerosol exposure significantly increased  post-exposure urinary acetate but not formate. These data suggest that E-cig use  may increase cardiopulmonary disease risk independent of the presence of  nicotine and/or flavorings. This study indicates that FA levels in tobacco  product-derived aerosols should be regulated to levels that do not induce  biomarkers of cardiopulmonary harm. There remains a need for reliable biomarkers  of exposure to inhaled FA and AA.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Use of electronic cigarettes  (E-cig) induces endothelial dysfunction (ED) in healthy humans, yet the specific  constituents in E-cig aerosols that contribute to ED are unknown. Our study  implicates formaldehyde that is formed in heating of E-cig solvents (propylene  glycol, PG; vegetable glycerin, VG).

Impact of Electronic Cigarette Vaping on Cerebral Ischemia: What We Know So Far.,"Siegel J(#)(1), Patel SH(#)(1), Mankaliye B(1), Raval AP(2)(3).",10.1007/s12975-022-01011-w,"Electronic cigarettes (ECs) are battery-powered nicotine delivery devices that  have rapidly gained popularity and attention globally. ECs work by heating a  liquid to produce an aerosol that usually contains nicotine, flavoring  compounds, and other chemicals, which are inhaled during vaping. EC aerosols are  depicted to contain a lower number and overall quantity of harmful toxicants  than conventional cigarettes (CCs). However, emerging research indicates that EC  aerosols contain harmful ingredients including ultrafine particles, volatile  organic compounds, and heavy metals. One common ingredient found in both CCs and  ECs is nicotine, which has been shown to be both highly addictive and toxic.  Particularly relevant to our current review, there is an enormous amount of  literature that shows that smoking-derived nicotine exacerbates ischemic brain  damage. Therefore, the question arises: will EC use impact the outcome of  stroke? ECs are highly popular and relatively new in the market; thus, our  understanding about the long-term effects of EC use on brain are lacking. The  current review strives to extrapolate the existing understanding of the  nicotine-induced effects of conventional smoking on the brain to the possible  effects that ECs may have on the brain, which may ultimately have a potential  for adverse stroke risk or severity.",Review of electronic cigarette effects.

LE(1)(3).",10.1093/cvr/cvad113,"Electronic cigarette use has grown exponentially in recent years, and while  their popularity has increased, the long-term effects on the heart are yet to be  fully studied and understood. Originally designed as devices to assist with  those trying to quit traditional combustible cigarette use, their popularity has  attracted use by teens and adolescents who traditionally have not smoked  combustible cigarettes. Acute effects on the heart have been shown to be similar  to traditional combustible cigarettes, including increased heart rate and blood  pressure. The main components of electronic cigarettes that contribute to these  arrhythmic effects are found in the e-liquid that is aerosolized and inhaled,  comprised of nicotine, flavourings, and a combination of vegetable glycerin (VG)  and propylene glycol (PG). Nicotine can potentially induce both ventricular and  atrial arrhythmogenesis, with both the atrial and ventricular effects resulting  from the interactions of nicotine and the catecholamines they release via  potassium channels. Atrial arrhythmogenesis, more specifically atrial  fibrillation, can also occur due to structural alterations, which happens  because of nicotine downregulating microRNAs 133 and 590, both  post-transcriptional growth factor repressors. Liquid flavourings and the  combination of PG and VG can possibly lead to arrhythmic events by exposing  users to acrolein, an aldehyde that stimulates TRPA1 that in turn causes a  change towards sympathetic activation and autonomic imbalance. The design of  these electronic delivery devices is constantly changing; therefore, it has  proven extremely difficult to study the long-term effects on the heart caused by  electronic cigarettes but will be important to understand given their rising  popularity. The arrhythmic effects of electronic cigarettes appear similar to  traditional cigarettes as well; however, a comprehensive review has not been  compiled and is the focus of this article.",Longitudinal observational study on

We determined,  using an ex vivo mechanistic atherogenesis assay, whether proatherogenic changes  including monocyte transendothelial migration and monocyte-derived foam cell  formation are increased in people who use ECIGs. METHODS: In a cross-sectional single-center study using plasma and peripheral  blood mononuclear cells from healthy participants who are nonsmokers or with  exclusive use of ECIGs or tobacco cigarettes (TCIGs), autologous peripheral  blood mononuclear cells with patient plasma and pooled peripheral blood  mononuclear cells from healthy nonsmokers with patient plasma were utilized to  dissect patient-specific ex vivo proatherogenic circulating factors present in  plasma and cellular factors present in monocytes. Our main outcomes were  monocyte transendothelial migration (% of blood monocyte cells that undergo  transendothelial migration through a collagen gel) and monocyte-derived foam  cell formation as determined by flow cytometry and the median fluorescence  intensity of the lipid-staining fluorochrome BODIPY in monocytes of participants  in the setting of an ex vivo model of atherogenesis. RESULTS: Study participants (N=60) had median age of 24.0 years (interquartile  range [IQR], 22.0-25.0 years), and 31 were females. Monocyte transendothelial  migration was increased in people who exclusively used TCIGs (n=18; median  [IQR], 2.30 [ 1.29-2.82]; P<0.001) and in people who exclusively used ECIGs  (n=21; median [IQR], 1.42 [ 0.96-1.91]; P<0.01) compared with nonsmoking  controls (n=21; median [IQR], 1.05 [0.66-1.24]). Monocyte-derived foam cell  formation was increased in people who exclusively used TCIGs (median [IQR], 2.01  [ 1.59-2.49]; P<0.001) and in people who exclusively used ECIGs (median [IQR],  1.54 [ 1.10-1.86]; P<0.001) compared with nonsmoker controls (median [IQR], 0.97  [0.86-1.22]). Both monocyte transendothelial migration and monocyte-derived foam  cell formation were higher in TCIG smokers compared with ECIG users and in ECIG  users who were former smokers versus ECIG users who were never smokers (P<0.05  for all comparisons). CONCLUSIONS: The finding of alterations in proatherogenic properties of blood  monocytes and plasma in TCIG smokers compared with nonsmokers validates this  assay as a strong ex vivo mechanistic tool with which to measure proatherogenic  changes in people who use ECIGs. Similar yet significantly less severe  alterations in proatherogenic properties of monocytes and plasma were detected  in the blood from ECIG users. Future studies are necessary to determine whether  these findings are attributable to a residual effect of prior smoking or are a  direct effect of current ECIG use.",Cross-sectional study on ECIG

What factors reliably predict electronic cigarette nicotine delivery?,"Blank MD(1), Pearson J(2)(3), Cobb CO(4), Felicione NJ(5), Hiler MM(4), Spindle 
TR(6), Breland A(4).",10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2019-055193,"BACKGROUND: The ability of an electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) to deliver  nicotine effectively may be dependent on features of the device, the liquid and  the user. Some of these features have been examined in previous work (eg, liquid  nicotine concentration and puff topography), while others have not (eg, nicotine  dependence and demographic characteristics). The purpose of this secondary  analysis is to examine such features as predictors of e-cigarette nicotine  delivery using a relatively large sample. METHODS: Four studies were combined in which e-cigarette-experienced users  (n=63; 89% men; 75% white) and e-cigarette-naïve cigarette smokers (n=67; 66%  men; 54% white) took 10 puffs from an eGo-style e-cigarette (~7.3 watts) filled  with liquid that had a nicotine concentration of 18, 25 or 36 mg/mL. Thus, held  constant across all studies were device features of battery/cartomiser style and  power level and the topography parameters of puff number and interpuff interval.  Blood was sampled before and after use, and puff topography was measured. Three  general linear models were conducted to predict plasma nicotine concentrations  (pre-post increase) for: (1) e-cigarette users only, (2) smokers only and (3)  both groups combined. Predictor variables included puff duration, puff volume,  liquid nicotine concentration, presession plasma nicotine concentration,  nicotine dependence score (smokers only), gender and race. RESULTS: In all models tested, longer puff durations and higher liquid nicotine  concentrations were associated significantly with increased nicotine delivery  (ps<0.05). For e-cigarette users only, higher presession nicotine concentration  was associated significantly with increased nicotine delivery (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Puff duration and liquid nicotine concentration may be among the  more important factors to consider as regulators attempt to balance e-cigarette  safety with efficacy. These findings should be interpreted in the context of  devices with relatively low power output, a variable not studied here but likely  also directly relevant to product regulation.",Secondary analysis of e-cigarette

Though advertised as safer than conventional cigarettes,  these devices have been found to contain carcinogenic chemicals, air pollutants,  and heavy metals. The purpose of this article is to shed light on the known  effects of vaping on the ocular setting and raise the discussion about  additional potential effects that may call for further investigation. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted for publications  pertaining to the effects of vaping on the eye. Relevant studies and findings  were summarized in this article. RESULTS: It was found that aldehydes and free radicals present in electronic  cigarettes may induce a disturbance in tear film stability, and vape flavorings  may damage the lipid layer through peroxidation. Corneal staining has been shown  to appear following exposure to e-cigarette vapor, with nicotine and acrolein  potentially inducing an inflammatory response in corneal epithelial cells. In  addition, nicotine has been shown to induce nystagmus, exert vasoconstrictive  effects on ocular blood flow, and may interfere with retinal light-adapted  vision. Vape-related explosions, though unpredictable, may also result in  decreased visual acuity along with long-term ocular trauma. CONCLUSION: Research discussing both the short-term and long-term effects of  vaping on the eye is limited. However, the potential harms of substances such as  nicotine and aldehydes warrant additional investigation and increased education  about the detriment that electronic cigarettes may inflict on sensitive organs.",Literature review on vaping effects

E-cigarettes contain a metallic  heating coil (composed of Ni, Cr, Al and other metals) to heat a solution  (commonly called e-liquid) and convert it into an aerosol. This aerosol is  inhaled (vaped) by the users who can be potentially exposed to a wide variety of  metals. We investigated the possible transfer of metals from the coil to the  e-liquid and the generated aerosol, and how the exposure to this aerosol can  increase metal body burden in e-cigarette users. We recruited 75 e-cigarette  users (50 who only vaped and 25 dual users who vaped and smoked) and 25 controls  who neither vaped nor smoked. E-liquid samples before (dispenser e-liquid) and  after (tank e-liquid) being added to their devices were collected. Aerosol  samples were collected using a condensation method. All participants provided  urine and hair samples. All samples were analyzed for metals by ICP-MS. We  observed higher metal concentrations in the aerosol and tank e-liquid (in  contact with the coil) compared to the dispenser e-liquid (before contact with  the coil). The median concentrations for some of the metals with the most  remarkable increases in aerosol and tank e-liquid vs. dispenser e-liquid were  36.90 and 62.73 vs. 18.29 μg/kg for Al; 6.71 and 28.97 vs. 0.98 μg/kg for Cr;  91.39 and 414.47 vs. 1.64 μg/kg for Ni; 738.99 and 744.24 vs. 16.56 μg/kg for  Zn; and 10.17 and 22.31 vs. 0.88 μg/kg for Pb. We also found detectable and  potentially high concentrations of other metals such as Mn, Cu, Sb and Sn. In  urine, increases in the median levels (μg/g creatinine) in vapers/duals vs.  controls were observed for some metals, including Cr (0.34/0.28 vs. 0.20), Cu  (1.72/2.36 vs. 1.46), Sn (0.26/0.31 vs. 0.18) and Pb (0.39/0.44 vs. 0.22). In  hair, there were no differences in metal concentrations among the three groups.  In conclusion, e-cigarettes are likely a source of metals such as Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb  or Sn. These metals come from the device, likely the heating resistance, as  their concentrations were low in the dispenser e-liquid and higher in the  aerosol and the e-liquid left in the tank. Although the exposure to e-cigarette  aerosol can have an influence in the body burden of metals, aerosol metal levels  were not clearly associated with metal levels in biological samples such as  urine or hair in e-cigarette users in this study.",Cross-sectional observational study on e

Neutrophils are central to the  pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, with changes in phenotype  and function implicated in tissue damage. OBJECTIVE: We sought to measure the impact of direct exposure to  nicotine-containing and nicotine-free e-cigarette vapor on human neutrophil  function and phenotype. METHODS: Neutrophils were isolated from the whole blood of self-reported  nonsmoking, nonvaping healthy volunteers. Neutrophils were exposed to 40 puffs  of e-cigarette vapor generated from e-cigarette devices using flavorless  e-cigarette liquids with and without nicotine before functions, deformability,  and phenotype were assessed. RESULTS: Neutrophil surface marker expression was altered, with CD62L and CXCR2  expression significantly reduced in neutrophils treated with e-cigarette vapor  containing nicotine. Neutrophil migration to IL-8, phagocytosis of Escherichia  coli and Staphylococcus aureus pHrodo bioparticles, oxidative burst response,  and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-stimulated neutrophil extracellular trap  formation were all significantly reduced by e-cigarette vapor treatments,  independent of nicotine content. E-cigarette vapor induced increased levels of  baseline polymerized filamentous actin levels in the cytoplasm, compared with  untreated controls. CONCLUSIONS: The significant reduction in effector neutrophil functions after  exposure to high-power e-cigarette devices, even in the absence of nicotine, is  associated with excessive filamentous actin polymerization.

Recent efforts have been made  to determine the potential health and policy benefits of reducing nicotine in  combustible cigarettes. The degree to which changes in blood nicotine relate to  measures of the abuse liability of reduced-nicotine cigarettes is unknown. The  current study examined the relation between blood nicotine and behavioral  economic demand measures of cigarettes differing in nicotine content. METHODS: Using a within-subject design, participants smoked a single cigarette  during each experimental session. Cigarettes included the participant's  usual-brand cigarette and SPECTRUM investigational cigarette differing in  nicotine level (mg of nicotine to g of tobacco; 15.8 mg/g, 5.2 mg/g, 2.4 mg/g,  1.3 mg/g, and 0.4 mg/g). During each session, blood was collected at multiple  timepoints and behavioral economic demand was assessed. Nonlinear mixed-effects  models were used to estimate differences in derived intensity (Q0) and change in  elasticity (α). RESULTS: Measures of blood nicotine decreased in an orderly fashion related to  nicotine level and significantly predicted change in elasticity (α), but not  derived intensity. No differences in demand parameters between the usual brand  and 15.8mg/g cigarettes were observed. However, α was significantly higher  (lower valuation) for 0.4mg/g than 15.8mg/g cigarettes. CONCLUSIONS: The lowest nicotine level (0.4mg/g) corresponded with the lowest  abuse liability (α) compared to the full-strength control (15.8mg/g), with the  1.3mg/g level also resulting in low abuse liability. IMPLICATIONS: This is the first study examining the relative contributions of  nicotine content in cigarettes and blood nicotine levels on the behavioral  economic demand abuse liability of cigarettes ranging in nicotine content. Our  results suggest blood nicotine and nicotine content both predict behavioral  economic demand abuse liability. In addition, our results suggest a nicotine  content of 1.3mg/g or lower may be effective at reducing cigarette uptake among  first-time (naïve) smokers. Our results largely conform to previous findings  suggesting a very low nicotine content cigarette maintains lower abuse liability  than full-strength cigarettes.",Nicotine content and abuse liability

Cigarette Users.","Pamungkasningsih SW(1), Taufik FF(2), Samoedro E(2), Andarini S(2), Susanto 
AD(2).",10.5152/eurasianjmed.2021.20009,"OBJECTIVE: Found in plasma, urine, and saliva, cotinine can be used as a  biomarker for nicotine in electronic cigarette (e-cig) users. Nicotine is  addictive and causes dependence. Thus, it becomes a problem in smoking cessation  programs. This study aimed to determine the relationship between urinary  cotinine (UCot) and nicotine dependence levels in regular male e-cig users. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study consecutively included regular  male e-cig users and nonsmokers. All subjects were interviewed and had their  UCot levels measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. The  regular e-cig users completed the Penn State Nicotine Dependence Index  questionnaire. RESULTS: This study recruited 71 males aged 18-45 years divided into e-cig users  and non-smokers group. The predominating characteristics in e-cig users are as  follows: 23 males (67.6%) aged <30 years, the highest education of senior high  school 25 (73.5%) and 25 (73.5%) subjects had occupation. The UCot levels among  the e-cig users in the non-dependency group were lower than that of the  medium-high dependency group (P = .008). The median value for UCot level in the  regular e-cig users was higher than that of the non-smoker group (276.11  [58.01-284.15] ng/mL vs 5.21 [4.65-23.72] ng/mL, P < .001). Factors influencing  the UCot levels of the e-cig users were age (P = .041), nicotine level of the  e-cig liquid (P = .013), and the flavor of the e-cig liquid (eg, menthol or  non-menthol; P = .040). CONCLUSION: UCot and nicotine dependence levels in the regular male e-cig users  were significantly related. Nicotine dependence was found in 76.5% of the  regular male e-cig users. The UCot levels in the e-cig users were significantly  higher than in the non-smokers.",Cross-sectional study on nicotine dependence

METHODS: Data came from two cycles (2015-2016 and 2017-2018) of the National  Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We used weighted logistic regression  models to determine the association of cigarette use and reduced high-density  lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C; <40 mg/dL, for men and <50 mg/dL for women),  elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C; ≥130 mg/dL), elevated  triglycerides (TG; ≥150 mg/dL), elevated fasting blood glucose (FBG;  (≥100 mg/dL), and high blood pressure (HBP; Systolic ≥130 mm Hg/Diastolic ≥85 mm  Hg). RESULTS: Of the 8688 adults 18+ years of age included, 2.7%, 3.2%, and 14.9%  self-reported exclusive e-cigarette, dual use, and exclusive cigarette smoking  respectively. After adjusting for covariates, exclusive e-cigarette use was  significantly associated with increased odds of HBP (adjusted odds ratio  [aOR] = 2.05, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.03, 4.08). Dual use was  associated with increased odds of reduced HDL-C (aOR = 1.64, 95% [CI] = 1.01,  2.70). Exclusive cigarette smoking was significantly associated with reduced  HDL-C (aOR=1.80, 95% [CI]=1.45, 2.23) and elevated TG (aOR = 1.59, 95% [CI] =  1.01, 2.52).

We reviewed the literature to  determine whether women who use hormonal contraceptives (HC) and electronic  cigarettes (e-cigarettes) also have an increased risk. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review. METHODS: We searched for articles reporting myocardial infarction (MI), stroke,  venous thromboembolism, peripheral arterial disease or changes to CV markers in  women using e-cigarettes and HC. We also searched for indirect evidence, such as  CV outcomes among e-cigarette users in the general population and among HC users  exposed to nicotine, propylene glycol or glycerol. RESULTS: No articles reported on outcomes among e-cigarette users using HC.  Among the general population, 13 articles reported on heart rate or blood  pressure after e-cigarette use. These markers generally remained normal, even  when significant changes were observed. In three studies, changes were less  pronounced after e-cigarette use than cigarette use. One MI was reported among  1012 people exposed to e-cigarettes in these studies. One article on nicotine  and HC exposure found both exposures to be significantly associated with acute  changes to heart rate, though mean heart rate remained normal. No articles on  propylene glycol or glycerol and HC exposure were identified. CONCLUSION: We identified no evidence on CV outcomes among e-cigarette users  using HC. Limited data reporting mostly acute outcomes suggested that CV events  are rare among e-cigarette users in the general population and that e-cigarettes  may affect heart rate and blood pressure less than conventional cigarettes.  There is a need for research assessing joint HC and e-cigarette exposure on  clinical CV outcomes.",Systematic review of e-cigarettes

brief report.","Mueller SD(1), Britton GR(1), James GD(1), Stewart Fahs P(1).",10.1080/03014460.2021.2010803,"BACKGROUND: Vaping, the use of an electronic device to deliver a drug-infused  aerosol has become an increasingly popular way to consume nicotine since its  introduction to the market in the early 2000s. Despite the differences in  consumption patterns relative to combustible tobacco, the impact of ad libitum  nicotine vaping on cardiovascular response has not been thoroughly studied. SUBJECT AND METHODS: This research was conducted on vapers (n = 17) and smokers  (n = 14) who represent a subsample of a larger study that explored the  relationship between nicotine use, activities of daily living and 24-hour  cardiovascular response using Spacelabs ambulatory blood pressure monitors.  These data were analysed via ANOVA models and t-tests using SPSS 25.0 for  Macintosh. RESULTS: Vapers consumed nicotine significantly more frequently than did  smokers, at 48.2% and 18.1% of every 15-minute waking measurement, respectively  (p = 0.000). The act of nicotine consumption, rather than the mode of delivery,  was significantly associated with increases in systolic, diastolic, mean  arterial pressure, and heart rate readings. There was no difference in the mean  amplitude of response to nicotine between vapers and smokers. CONCLUSIONS: This study's strong statistical findings, visually evident on  ambulatory blood pressure monitor reports, demonstrated that ad libitum nicotine  consumption has an acute, dose-dependent effect on cardiovascular response  regardless of whether it is smoked or vaped. However, since vapers consumed  nicotine more frequently, future studies should be conducted with larger sample  sizes, and controlled for age and comorbidities to improve statistical strength. IMPLICATIONS: This pilot study reveals that, when ad lib consumption is  documented and measured, vaping has unique and potentially harmful effects on  blood pressure, pulse, and mean arterial pressure. Because nicotine is consumed  for much longer stretches, vapers have fewer rest periods between nicotine  doses.",Pilot study on nicotine consumption

METHODS: A retrospective review of 12 cases of EVALI admitted to the Bristol  Meyers Squibb Children's Hospital between February 2020 and June 2020 was  conducted. RESULTS: The ages of the patients ranged from 14 to 19 years. There were  six males and six females. Three patients had a past history of anxiety,  depression, or other psychiatric/mental health disorder, 9 had prolonged  coagulation profile (prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and/or  International Normalized Ratio), and 11 had elevated inflammatory markers. Eight  needed respiratory support. All 12 were negative for SARS-CoV-2 PCR. Four were  tested for IgG antibodies and were negative.

METHODS: Subjects were recruited among those responding to a social media  announcement or patients attending the SEGi Oral Health Care Centre between May  and December 2019, and among some staff at the centre. Five ml of unstimulated    whole saliva was collected and salivary LDH enzyme activity levels were measured  with a LDH colorimetric assay kit. Salivary LDH activity level was determined  for each group and compared statistically. RESULTS: Eighty-eight subjects were categorized into three groups (control n=30,  smokers n=29, and vapers n=29).

METHODS: We examined blood nicotine levels in smokers who were non-accustomed to  e-cigarette use (Study 1) and accustomed e-cigarette users (Study 2). We  compared nicotine levels when participants used a closed modular system  e-cigarette to those when participants smoked a cigarette. RESULTS: In Study 1, Cmax (geometric mean (CV)) during a 5-minute puffing period  (10 puffs, 30 seconds apart) was 13.4 (51.4) ng/ ml for a regular cigarette. The  e-cigarette Cmax was significantly lower (p .05) at 2.5 (67.8) ng/ml. In Study  2, during a 5-minute ad libitum puffing period, cigarette Cmax was 7.2 (130.8)  ng/mL, and it was 7.8 (108.2) ng/mL for the e-cigarette. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate heterogeneity of nicotine deliveries both  between products and also with the same products used by different cohorts, eg,  accustomed users versus smokers. Such differences must be taken into account  when determining the likely behavioral impact, on smoking reduction and  cessation, of nicotine delivery data and when planning e-cigarette nicotine  pharmacokinetic studies.",Nicotine delivery study with smokers

review.","Garcia PD(1), Gornbein JA(2)(3), Middlekauff HR(4).",10.1007/s10286-020-00683-4,"PURPOSE: Electronic cigarettes (ECs) are the fastest growing tobacco product in  the USA, and ECs, like tobacco cigarettes (TCs), have effects on the  cardiovascular autonomic nervous system, with clinical implications. The purpose  of this review was to collect and synthesize available studies that have  investigated the autonomic cardiovascular effects of EC use in humans. Special  attention is paid to the acute and chronic effects of ECs, the relative  contributions of the nicotine versus non-nicotine constituents in EC emissions  and the relative effects of ECs compared to TCs. METHODS: Using the methodology described in the Preferred Reporting Items for  Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement, we conducted a  literature search of the Ovid PubMed and Embase databases on 6 December 2019  using keywords in titles and abstracts of published literature. Acute (minutes  to hours) and chronic (days or longer) changes in heart rate variability (HRV),  heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) were used as estimates of cardiovascular  autonomic effects. RESULTS: Nineteen studies were included in this systematic review, all of which  used earlier generation EC devices. Acute EC vaping increased HR and BP less  than acute TC smoking. Nicotine but not non-nicotine constituents in EC aerosol  were responsible for the sympathoexcitatory effects. The results of chronic EC  vaping studies were consistent with a chronic sympathoexcitatory effect as  estimated by HRV, but this did not translate into chronic increases in HR or BP. CONCLUSIONS: Electronic cigarettes are sympathoexcitatory. Cardiac  sympathoexcitatory effects are less when vaping using the earlier generation ECs  than when smoking TCs.

The implications of vaping on surgical wound healing: A systematic review.,"Ashour O(1), Al-Huneidy L(2), Noordeen H(3).",10.1016/j.surg.2023.02.017,"BACKGROUND: E-cigarette use is rapidly growing, and little is known about the  postoperative complications. Cigarette smoking has been well-established to be  associated with delayed wound healing and increased complications in surgical  patients. Due to the intricate and harmonious nature of the wound-healing  process, vaping may impair tissue regeneration, posing a risk for patients  undergoing surgery. This systematic review aimed to review the evidence on the  implications of vaping on wound healing. METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed and Scopus databases was conducted on  October 2022 per Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and  Meta-Analyses guidelines. The following keywords were used to conduct the  search: vaping, vape, e-cigarettes, electronic cigarettes, wound healing, tissue  regeneration, postoperative complications, wound infection, and blood flow. RESULTS: Of 5,265 screened articles, only 37 were eligible for qualitative  synthesis. A total of 18 articles studied the effect of e-cigarettes on human  volunteers, 14 investigated e-cigarette extract on human cell lines, and 5 used  animal rat models. CONCLUSION: Despite limited objective data, the recommendation is that  e-cigarettes be treated as tobacco cigarettes; hence, vaping should be stopped  in the perioperative period to decrease the incidence of wound healing  complications.

In animal models, exposure to e-cigarette has been  reported to result in pulmonary and cardiovascular injury, and in humans, the  acute use of e-cigarettes increases heart rate and blood pressure and induces  endothelial dysfunction. In both animal models and humans, cardiovascular  dysfunction associated with e-cigarettes has been linked to reactive aldehydes  such as formaldehyde and acrolein generated in e-cigarette aerosols. These  aldehydes are known products of heating and degradation of vegetable glycerin  (VG) present in e-liquids. Here, we report that in mice, acute exposure to a  mixture of propylene glycol:vegetable glycerin (PG:VG) or to e-cigarette-derived  aerosols significantly increased the urinary excretion of acrolein and glycidol  metabolites─3-hydroxypropylmercapturic acid (3HPMA) and  2,3-dihydroxypropylmercapturic acid (23HPMA)─as measured by UPLC-MS/MS. In  humans, the use of e-cigarettes led to an increase in the urinary levels of  23HPMA but not 3HPMA. Acute exposure of mice to aerosols derived from PG:13C3-VG  significantly increased the 13C3 enrichment of both urinary metabolites  13C3-3HPMA and 13C3-23HPMA. Our stable isotope tracing experiments provide  further evidence that thermal decomposition of vegetable glycerin in the  e-cigarette solvent leads to generation of acrolein and glycidol. This suggests  that the adverse health effects of e-cigarettes may be attributable in part to  these reactive compounds formed through the process of aerosolizing nicotine.  Our findings also support the notion that 23HPMA, but not 3HPMA, may be a  relatively specific biomarker of e-cigarette use.",Human and animal metabolite study

We aimed to  evaluate the effects of vaping e-cigs during gestation on offspring growth and  to asses if growth deficits are accompanied by altered maternal and fetal  vascular hemodynamics. Sprague-Dawley dams were assigned to Pair-Fed Control,  Pair-Fed Juice, or Juice+Nicotine groups, and then underwent either a prenatal  or prenatal+postnatal exposure paradigm in a custom-engineered vaping system.  Mass spectrometry identified major aerosolized constituents from e-cig vaping.  The Juice+Nicotine group exhibited significantly decreased fetal weight and  crown-rump length (↓46.56%, and ↓23.83%, respectively). Pre- and postnatal  exposure to Juice+Nicotine resulted in decreased pup weight at postnatal day  (PND) 4-10. Crown-rump length was decreased by 24.71% on PND 10. Blood flow in  the Juice+Nicotine group was decreased in the maternal uterine and fetal  umbilical circuits by 49.50% and 65.33%, respectively. We conclude that chronic  exposure to e-cig aerosols containing nicotine during early development can have  deleterious health effects on the exposed offspring. Vaping e-cigs containing  nicotine during pregnancy lead to a reduction in offspring weight and crown-rump  length, associated with a marked decrease in blood flow in both the maternal  uterine and fetal umbilical circulation (a strong indicator of growth  restriction).

Daily exposure to nicotine  assessed via salivary cotinine was similar to those reported for other  e-cigarette and tobacco cigarette users in general. The majority reported low to  moderate nicotine dependence. Qualitative interview themes included: the  importance of social networks in adoption and use of the product; device  features such as small size and vapor cloud reinforced product use; the product  provided satisfaction compared to a tobacco cigarette; and a perceived sense of  addiction to the product. CONCLUSIONS: JUUL e-cigarettes expose users to levels of nicotine similar to  other e-cigarettes but may be more satisfying due to unique device features.  JUUL may be quite acceptable to tobacco cigarette smokers who are seeking to  quit. However, it holds addictive potential and can reinforce long-term nicotine  use.",Cross-sectional qualitative study on J

We  compared nicotine delivery and subjective effects associated with the use of two  classes of e-cigarettes and cigarettes. METHODS: 14 e-cigarette users were instructed to vape their own e-cigarette  device every 20 seconds for 10 minutes while blood was drawn at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8,  10,12, and 15 minutes after initiating vaping. Users rated withdrawal symptoms  and side effects before and after vaping. E-cigarette devices were classified as  first-generation (same size as cigarette, no activation button) or advanced  (larger than cigarette with an activation button). Separately, 10 cigarette  smokers completed a similar protocol. Fisher's Exact Test and two-sided t-tests  were used as appropriate to determine differences in outcomes between  first-generation e-cigarette users, advanced e-cigarette users, and smokers. RESULTS: Compared to first-generation devices, advanced devices were associated  with greater serum nicotine Cmax (ng/ml) (11.5 v. 2.8, p = 0.0231) and greater  nicotine boost (ng/ml) (10.8 v. 1.8, p = 0.0177). Overall, e-cigarettes users  experienced a significant reduction in withdrawal and craving, although there  were no significant differences between users of first-generation and advanced  devices. Comparing e-cigarettes overall to cigarettes, cigarettes were  associated with greater Cmax (25.9 v. 9.0, p = 0.0043) and greater nicotine  boost (21.0 v. 8.2, p = 0.0128). CONCLUSIONS: Advanced e-cigarettes delivered significantly more nicotine than  first-generation devices but less than combustible cigarettes. Overall,  e-cigarette use was associated with a reduction in withdrawal and craving with  no reported side effects. The wide variation in nicotine absorption from  different e-cigarette devices should be considered in studies of e-cigarettes  for smoking cessation.",Comparative observational study on nicotine

While DNA adducts of  metabolites of nitrosamines 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK)  and N-nitrosonornicotine (NNN) are well-known tobacco-related cancer biomarkers,  only a few studies implicate NNN and NNK in DNA oxidation in humans. NNK and NNN  were found in the urine of E-cigarette users who never smoked cigarettes. This  paper proposes the first chemical pathways of DNA oxidation driven by NNK and  NNN metabolites in redox reactions with Cu2+ and NADPH leading to reactive  oxygen species (ROS). A microfluidic array with thin films of DNA and metabolic  enzymes that make metabolites of NNN and NNK in the presence of Cu2+ and NADPH  was used to estimate relative rates of DNA oxidation. Detection by  electrochemiluminescence (ECL) employed a new ECL dye [Os(tpy-benz-COOH)2]2+  that is selective for and sensitive to the primary DNA oxidation product  8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) in DNA. Enzyme-DNA films on  magnetic beads were used to produce nitrosamine metabolites that enter  ROS-forming redox cycles with Cu2+ and NADPH, and liquid chromatography-mass  spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to quantify 8-oxodG and identify metabolites. ROS  were detected by optical sensors. Metabolites of NNK and NNN + Cu2+ + NADPH  generated relatively high rates of DNA oxidation. Lung is the exposure route in  smoking and vaping, human lung tissue contains Cu2+ and NADPH, and lung  microsomal enzymes gave the highest rates of DNA oxidation in this study. Also,  E-cigarette vapor contains 6-fold more copper than that in cigarette smoke,  which could exacerbate DNA oxidation.",In vitro laboratory experimental study.

We aimed to examine the extent to which ENDSs or a non-nicotine cigarette  substitute influence tobacco-related toxicant exposure and cigarette consumption  in smokers interested in smoking reduction. METHODS: We did a four-arm, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial at two  sites in the USA (Penn State University, Hershey, PA, and Virginia Commonwealth  University, Richmond, VA). We enrolled adults aged 21-65 years who smoked more  than nine cigarettes per day (for at least the past year), with exhaled CO of  more than 9 parts per million at screening, who were not currently using an  ENDS, and who were interested in reducing smoking but not quitting. Participants  were randomised (site-specific with allocation concealment; 1:1:1:1) to receive  either a cartomiser-based, pen-style ENDS (eGo-style) paired with 0, 8, or 36  mg/mL liquid nicotine (participants and researchers masked to concentration) or  a non-ENDS cigarette-shaped plastic tube that delivered no nicotine or aerosol  (cigarette substitute; unmasked) for 24 weeks. Conditions were chosen to reflect  a range of nicotine delivery including none (cigarette substitute and 0 mg/mL  ENDS), low (8 mg/mL), and cigarette-like (36 mg/mL), and all conditions were  paired with smoking reduction instructions. The primary outcome was  concentration of the tobacco-specific carcinogen metabolite  4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL; urinary total) collected at  randomisation and at 4, 12, and 24 weeks. Multiple imputation with and without  covariate adjustment was used in addition to sensitivity analyses. This trial is  registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02342795. FINDINGS: Between July 22, 2015, and Nov 16, 2017, 684 individuals were screened  and 520 (76%) were enrolled and randomised. 188 (36%) of 520 participants were  lost to follow-up by week 24; attrition did not differ by study group (39 [30%]  of 130 in the cigarette substitute group, 56 [43%] of 130 in the ENDS with 0  mg/mL nicotine group, 49 [38%] of 130 in the ENDS 8 mg/mL group, and 44 [34%] of  130 in the ENDS 36 mg/mL group). Urinary total NNAL at 24 weeks in the ENDS with  36 mg/mL nicotine group was 210·80 pg/mg creatinine (95% CI 163·03-274·42)  compared with 346·09 pg/mg creatinine (265·00-455·32) in the cigarette  substitute group (p=0·0061). No other significant differences between groups  were observed for any time point for urinary total NNAL. Serious adverse event  frequency was similar across groups (12 events in 12 participants [9%] in the  ENDS with 36 mg/mL nicotine group, seven events in six participants [5%] in the  8 mg/mL group, 11 events in ten participants [8%] in the 0 mg/mL group, and 13  events in 13 participants [10%] in the cigarette substitute group), and all of  these were deemed unrelated or unlikely to be related to study product use.  There was one death between randomisation and 24 weeks (suicide; in the ENDS  with 0 mg/mL nicotine group). INTERPRETATION: Use of an ENDS with cigarette-like nicotine delivery can reduce  exposure to a major pulmonary carcinogen, NNAL, even with concurrent smoking.  Future ENDS trials should involve products with well characterised nicotine  delivery, including those with nicotine delivery approaching that of a  cigarette.

AIMS AND METHODS: In 2019-2020, people who use pod-mods in the San Francisco Bay  Area completed questionnaires and provided a urine sample for analysis of total  nicotine equivalents (TNE). The relationship between TNE and e-cigarette use,  e-cigarette brands, e-liquid nicotine strength, e-cigarette dependence, and  urine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL), as a measure of  combustible cigarette exposure, were examined. RESULTS: Of 100 participants (64% male, 71% in the 18-34 age group, 45% white),  53 used JUUL primarily, 12 used Puff Bar primarily, and 35 used other brands,  including Suorin; 48 participants reported current cigarette smoking.  Participants most often reported use of e-liquid with 4.5%-6.0% nicotine (68%),  fruit (35%), tobacco (28%), and menthol or mint flavors (26%), used e-cigarettes  on 25.5 (SD = 6.3) days a month, 10.2 (SD = 14.2) times a day, and 40% used 1-2  pods/cartridges per week. In bivariate analysis, urinary TNE was higher with  greater frequency (days used) and intensity (number of pods used) of e-cigarette  use, e-cigarette dependence, and combustible cigarette use. In multivariable  analysis, days of e-cigarette use in the last 30 days, number of pods used per  week, and NNAL levels were significantly associated with TNE. There was no  significant impact of e-liquid nicotine strength on TNE. CONCLUSIONS: Nicotine intake among people who used pod-mod e-cigarettes  increased with e-cigarette consumption and e-cigarette dependence, but not with  e-liquid nicotine strength. Our findings may inform whether FDA adopts a  nicotine standard for e-cigarettes. IMPLICATIONS: The study examined how device and user characteristics influence  nicotine intake among pod-mod e-cigarette users. Nicotine intake increased with  frequency (days of e-cigarette use in past 30 days) intensity of use (number of  pods used per day) and e-cigarette dependence but not with the flavor or  nicotine concentration of the e-liquids. Regulation of nicotine concentration of  e-liquids is unlikely to influence nicotine exposure among adult experienced  pod-mod users.",Cross-sectional observational study on e

However, there was limited evidence on the  relationship of triglyceride-glucose index (TyG) index, a simple, valuable  marker of insulin resistance, with AF. Thus, we aimed to investigate the  association between TyG index and AF among hospitalized patients. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted in Daping Hospital,  which included 356 hospitalized patients from the Department of Cardiology.  Clinical and biochemical parameters were collected from electronic medical  records and AF was diagnosed from electrocardiogram (ECG) findings. RESULTS: We found that the TyG index was significantly higher in the AF group  than in the group without AF. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that  hypertension (OR = 1.756, 95%CI 1.135-2.717, P = 0.011) and TyG index (OR =  2.092, 95%CI 1.412-3.100, P<0.001) were positively associated with AF. The  analysis of the area under the ROC curve was performed and revealed that area  under curve (AUC) of TyG index was 0.600 (95%CI, 0.542-0.659, P = 0.001), the  optimal critical value was 8.35, the sensitivity was 65.4%, and the specificity  was 52.0%. Additional subgroup analyses of diabetic and non-diabetic subjects  were also performed and found the TyG index was increased in non-diabetic  subjects with AF.

E-cigs are different  from regular cigarettes in that E-cig devices are highly customizable, and users  can change the e-liquid composition (such as the base solution, flavors, and  nicotine level). Since the effects of E-cigs on the microvascular responses in  skeletal muscle are poorly understood, we used intravital microscopy with an  acute (one-time 10 puff) exposure paradigm to evaluate the individual components  of e-liquid on vascular tone and endothelial function in the arterioles of the  gluteus maximus muscle of anesthetized C57Bl/6 mice. Consistent with the  molecular responses seen with endothelial cells, we found that the peripheral  vasoconstriction response was similar between mice exposed to E-cig aerosol or  cigarette smoke (i.e., 3R4F reference cigarette); this response was not nicotine  dependent, and endothelial cell-mediated vasodilation was not altered within  this acute exposure paradigm. We also report that, regardless of the base  solution component [i.e., vegetable glycerin (VG)-only or propylene glycol  (PG)-only], the vasoconstriction responses were the same in mice with inhalation  exposure to 3R4F cigarette smoke or E-cig aerosol. Key findings from this work  reveal that some component other than nicotine, in inhaled smoke or aerosol, is  responsible for triggering peripheral vasoconstriction in skeletal muscle, and  that regardless of one's preference for an E-cig base solution composition  (i.e., ratio of VG-to-PG), the acute physiological response to blood vessels  appears to be the same. The data suggest that vaping is not likely to be 'safer'  than smoking towards blood vessels and can be expected to produce and/or result  in the same adverse vascular health outcomes associated with smoking cigarettes.",Experimental animal study on vaping.

AIMS AND METHODS: A randomized, open-label, crossover clinical study was  conducted on 23 healthy adult Chinese smokers. In two sessions, subjects used  either the e-cigarettes with 30 mg/g nicotine in e-liquid or conventional  cigarettes of a given brand, at one puff every 30 seconds for a total of 10  puffs. Blood samples were collected at specified time points for 4 hours after  the first puff. Subjective effects on desire-to-smoke and physiological  parameters such as heart rate and oxyhemoglobin saturation levels were also  examined before and after using the two products. RESULTS: The baseline-adjusted maximum nicotine concentration (Cmax-BL),  time-to-peak nicotine concentration (Tmax), and nicotine absorption rate  (Cmax-BL divided by Tmax) were found to be similar for the e-cigarette versus  those of conventional cigarettes (p > .05). Total nicotine exposure measured as  the area-under-curve (AUC0-t-BL) was significantly lower for the e-cigarette  relative to that of conventional cigarettes. In addition, the subjects found  that e-cigarettes were well tolerated under controlled puffing conditions.

Exposure Performed Experimentally.",Aslaner O(1).,10.1159/000518204,"OBJECTIVE: Cigarette smoking is a life-threatening habit that has rapidly spread  in every socioeconomic part of the public worldwide. There exist mechanisms of  nicotine delivery available to use in the hope of halting cigarette smoking, and  the electronic cigarette (EC) is one of the common methods used for tobacco  smoking replacement. This study aimed to investigate experimentally the  oxidative effects of tobacco smoke and EC smoke which contain nicotine. METHOD: We constructed smoke circuit rooms for exposing the rats to EC or  tobacco smoke. Three groups were created, the control group (N = 8); the  electronic cigarette group (N = 8), exposure to electronic cigarette smoke for 2  h per day; and the tobacco group (N = 8), exposure to traditional cigarette  smoke for 2 h per day. After the first and second week of exposure, blood  samples were obtained, and serum oxidative stress index (OSI), paraoxonase 1  (PON1) activity, and prolidase levels were evaluated. RESULTS: Higher values of OSI and prolidase levels were detected in the first  week of EC or tobacco smoke exposure in both study groups (p < 0.001) when  compared with the control group, and partial decrements were observed in the  second week. By contrast, elevated PON1 levels were observed in the second week  after EC or tobacco smoke exposure. The highest OSI levels were observed in the  tobacco smoke group (p < 0.001). The lowest values of PON1 levels were detected  in the first week of the electronic cigarette smoke group, and this decremental  value was statistically different than normal, the second week of the electronic  cigarette smoke group, the first week of the traditional cigarette smoke  exposure group, and the second week of the traditional cigarette smoke exposure  group values (p < 0.000). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that EC smoke induced oxidative stress.  Therefore, ECs are potentially risky for human health and can lead to important  health problems.",Experimental comparative study on smokers.

DESIGN: Cross-over, within-subjects study in which participants attended after  overnight abstinence on separate sessions and smoked a cigarette or used Juul or  eight other types of e-cigarettes (EC) ad libitum for 5 minutes. The Juul  product used was the version available in the United States that has more  nicotine in the e-liquid than the one available in the European Union. SETTING: Laboratory setting in the United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty dual users (smokers who also vape) provided data on Juul  and cigarettes, with eight also providing data on other EC products. MEASUREMENTS: At each session, number of puffs taken was counted during the  5-minute product use period and blood samples were taken at baseline and at 2,  4, 6, 8, 10 and 30 minutes after starting smoking/vaping and analysed for  nicotine. Participants also monitored their urges to smoke and rated the  products on a range of characteristics. FINDINGS: Juul's PK profile was close to the PK profile of cigarettes [maximum  concentration (Cmax ) = 20.4 versus 19.2 ng/ml; time to maximum concentration  (Tmax ) = 4 versus 6 minutes; area under the curve (AUC): 307.9 versus 312.6,  respectively].

METHODS AND RESULTS: We used a passive e-vape vapor inhalation system where  C57BL/6J mice (10-12 weeks old) were exposed to JUUL e-cigarette vape. Menthol  flavored JUUL pods containing 5% nicotine by weight were used as the e-liquid.  Mice were exposed to a total of 70 puffs daily for 2 weeks; 3-second puff  duration, and 25-second puff interval. The effects of JUUL relative to clean air  were analyzed, on mouse platelet function in vitro (eg, aggregation) and in vivo  (eg, FeCl3-induced carotid artery injury thrombosis model). Our results indicate  that short-term exposure to JUUL e-cigarette causes hyperactivation of platelets  and shortens the thrombus occlusion as well as hemostasis/bleeding times,  relative to clean air (medians of 14 vs. 200 seconds, P < .01 and 35 vs. 295  seconds, P < .001, respectively).

We examined perturbations in zebrafish  embryonic development after exposures to two cinnamon flavored vaping liquids  (with 12 mg/ml nicotine and without nicotine) for e-cigarettes from two  different vendors, as well as the flavoring chemical cinnamaldehyde. We focused  on the effects of the vaping liquids on hatching success and bone, cartilage and  blood vessel development in 3-4 days old transgenic zebrafish larvae. We found  that exposures to both of the vaping liquids perturbed the development of the  cleithrum and craniofacial cartilage. Exposure to the liquids further caused  non-overlapping and partially or completely missing intersegmental vessels.  Hatching success was also reduced. Exposure to pure cinnamaldehyde replicated  the effects of the vaping liquids with a 50% effect concentration (EC50) of  34-41 µM. Quantification of the amount of cinnamaldehyde in the vaping liquids  by mass spectrometry revealed EC50s around 10-40 times lower than for pure  cinnamaldehyde, suggesting that additional compounds or metabolites present in  the vaping liquids mediate toxicity. Presence of nicotine in one of the vaping  liquids decreased its EC50s about two fold compared to the liquid without  nicotine. Exposure to the humectants propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin did  not affect the vascular, cartilage or bone development in zebrafish embryos.

The EC with 48 mg/ml nicotine generated the closest  PK profile (C max = 13.6 ng/ml, T max = 4 min, AUC0->30 = 245 ng/ml/min),  followed by a third generation EC using 20 mg/ml nicotine (C max = 11.9 ng/ml, T  max = 6 min, AUC0->30 = 232 ng/ml/min), followed by the tank system using  20 mg/ml nicotine (C max = 9.9 ng/ml, T max = 6 min, AUC0->30 = 201 ng/ml/min).  Cig-a-like PK values were similar, ranging from C max 7.5 to 9.7 ng/ml, T max  4-6 min, and AUC0->30 144 to 173 ng/ml/min. Moderate differences in e-liquid  nicotine concentrations had little effect on nicotine delivery, e.g. the EC with  24 mg/ml cartridge had the same PK profile as ECs with 16 mg/ml cartridges.  Using similar strength e-liquid, the tank EC provided significantly more  nicotine than cig-a-like ECs. CONCLUSIONS: EC brands we tested do not deliver nicotine as efficiently as  cigarettes, but newer EC products deliver nicotine more efficiently than  cig-a-like brands. Moderate variations in nicotine content of e-liquid have  little effect on nicotine delivery. Smokers who are finding cig-a-like EC  unsatisfactory should be advised to try more advanced systems.",Comparative nicotine delivery study.

These devices are designed to imitate regular cigarettes,  delivering nicotine via inhalation without combusting tobacco but currently,  there is a lack of scientific evidence on the presence or absence of nicotine  exposure. Such research relies on evidence from e-cigarette users urine samples.  In this study, we aimed to determine the levels and compare the amount of  nicotine to which e-cigarette users, cigarette smokers and passive smokers are  exposed. Therefore, urine samples were collected from e-cigarette users,  cigarette smokers, passive smokers, and healthy nonsmokers. The urinary cotinine  levels of the subjects were determined using gas chromatography-mass  spectrometry. The mean (±SD) urinary cotinine levels were determined as  1755 ± 1848 ng/g creatinine for 32 e-cigarette users, 1720 ± 1335 ng/g  creatinine for 33 cigarette smokers and 81.42 ± 97.90 ng/g creatinine for 33  passive smokers. A significant difference has been found between cotinine levels  of e-cigarette users and passive smokers (p < 0.05). There were no statistically  significant differences between e-cigarette users and cigarette smokers  (p > 0.05). This is a seminal study to demonstrate the e-cigarette users are  exposed to nicotine as much as cigarette smokers.",Comparative observational study on exposure

However, there is evidence for critical cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and  respiratory side effects. Nevertheless, long-term vaping effects on thrombocyte  reactivity have not been investigated. Therefore, we investigated the influence  of vaping on thrombocyte reactivity in comparison to standard smoking and  non-smoking. METHODS: Platelet function was measured by Multiplate Impedance Aggregometry as  area under the curve (AUC). Smoking habits and characteristics were assessed by  questionnaire. Results were analyzed using inverse probability of treatment  weighting (IPTW) and conventional t-tests to test for robustness. RESULTS: After IPTW adjustment, participants in all groups were balanced by age,  gender, body height and weight. Collagen-induced aggregation was higher in  vapers compared to non-smokers (non-smokers 52.55 ± 23.97 vs. vapers  66.63 ± 18.96 AUC, p = 0.002) and to smokers (vapers vs. smokers 49.50 ± 26.05  AUC, p < 0.0001). ADP-induced aggregation in vapers was higher compared to  non-smokers (non-smokers 33.16 ± 16.61 vs. vapers 45.27 ± 18.67 AUC, p = 0.001)  and was numerically increased compared to smokers (vapers vs. smokers  40.09 ± 19.80 AUC, p = 0.08). These findings remained robust in t-test analysis. CONCLUSION: This study provides first evidence that vaping leads to enhanced  platelet reactivity compared to standard smoking and non-smoking. This suggests  health effects of vaping might be more severe than previously assumed. Whether  this effect translates to clinical outcome with a higher incidence of major  cardiovascular events, should be evaluated in large-scaled clinical studies.",Comparative observational study on vaping

This study reports a convenient  solvent extraction method for determining total nicotine and its partitioning in  ECIG liquids and aerosols by gas chromatography. Commercial ECIG liquids and  aerosols were analyzed, and it was found that most of the nicotine was in the  Nic form, with aerosols exhibiting higher Nic fraction than the parent liquids.

Here, we delineate the underlying mechanisms of  ECV-induced vascular endothelial dysfunction (VED), a central trigger of  cardiovascular disease. C57/BL6 male mice were exposed to ECV generated from  e-cig liquid containing 0, 6, or 24 mg/mL nicotine for 16 and 60 wk.  Time-dependent elevation in blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance were  observed, along with an impairment of acetylcholine-induced aortic relaxation in  ECV-exposed mice, compared with air-exposed control. Decreased intravascular  nitric oxide (NO) levels and increased superoxide generation with elevated  3-nitrotyrosine levels in the aorta of ECV-exposed mice were observed,  indicating that ECV-induced superoxide reacts with NO to generate cytotoxic  peroxynitrite. Exposure increased NADPH oxidase expression, supporting its role  in ECV-induced superoxide generation. Downregulation of endothelial nitric oxide  synthase (eNOS) expression and Akt-dependent eNOS phosphorylation occurred in  the aorta of ECV-exposed mice, indicating that exposure inhibited de novo NO  synthesis. Following ECV exposure, the critical NOS cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin  was decreased, with a concomitant loss of its salvage enzyme, dihydrofolate  reductase. NADPH oxidase and NOS inhibitors abrogated ECV-induced superoxide  generation in the aorta of ECV-exposed mice. Together, our data demonstrate that  ECV exposure activates NADPH oxidase and uncouples eNOS, causing a vicious cycle  of superoxide generation and vascular oxidant stress that triggers VED and  hypertension with predisposition to other cardiovascular disease.NEW &  NOTEWORTHY Underlying mechanisms of e-cig-induced vascular endothelial  dysfunction are delineated. e-cig exposure activates and increases expression of  NADPH oxidase and disrupts activation and coupling of eNOS, leading to a vicious  cycle of superoxide generation and peroxynitrite formation, with  tetrahydrobiopterin depletion, causing loss of NO that triggers vascular  endothelial dysfunction. This process is progressive, increasing with the  duration of e-cig exposure, and is more severe in the presence of nicotine, but  observed even with nicotine-free vaping.",Experimental mouse model study.

It is estimated that up to 15% of pregnant women are now using e-cigs  in the US which keeps increasing at an alarming rate. Harmful effects of tobacco  smoking during pregnancy are well documented for both pregnancy and postnatal  health, however limited preclinical and clinical studies exist to evaluate the  long-term effects of prenatal e-cig exposure on postnatal health. Therefore, the  aim of our study is to evaluate the effect of maternal e-cig use on postnatal  blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity and behavioral outcomes of mice of varying  age and sex. In this study, pregnant CD1 mice (E5) were exposed to e-Cig vapor  (2.4% nicotine) until postnatal day (PD) 7. Weight of the offspring was measured  at PD0, PD7, PD15, PD30, PD45, PD60 and PD90.

A short time  after launching the initial version in Europe, JUUL pods have been modified in  terms of the wick material used. This modification has been demonstrated  previously to lead to an elevated aerosol generation, consequently, to a larger  amount of nicotine per puff generated. The present study was designed to assess  whether the mentioned differences between the ""initial"" and ""modified"" JUUL  versions may cause a significant difference during consumption, and how nicotine  delivery compares with tobacco cigarettes. In this single-center three-arm  study, nicotine pharmacokinetics and influence on urge to smoke/vape were  compared for tobacco cigarettes, the ""initial"" version of the European JUUL, and  the ""modified"" version of the European JUUL.

Activated THP-1 cells were perfused  through the channels and a perfusion, adhesion period and wash cycle performed  four times with increasing adhesion period lengths (10, 20, 30 and 40 min).  THP-1 cell adhesion was quantified by counting adherent cells. WSCM induced  dose-dependent increases in monocyte adhesion compared to vehicle control. No  such increases were observed for eVCM or nicotine. Adhesion regulation was  linked to increased ICAM-1 protein expression. Staining of ICAM-1 in HAECs and  CD11b (MAC-1) in THP-1 cells demonstrated adhesion molecule co-localisation in  BioFlux plates. The ICAM-1 adhesion response to WSCM was downregulated by  transfecting HAECs with ICAM-1 siRNA.

METHODS: 11 males and 3 females participated in a 3-day inpatient crossover  study with strawberry, tobacco, and their usual flavor e-liquid. Nicotine levels  were nominally 18mg/mL in the strawberry (pH 8.29) and tobacco (pH 9.10)  e-liquids and ranged between 3-18mg/mL in the usual brands (mean pH 6.80). Each  day consisted of a 15-puff session followed by 4h of abstinence, then 90min of  ad libitum use. Subjects used a KangerTech mini ProTank 3. RESULTS: After 15 puffs, the amount of nicotine inhaled and systemically  retained were not significantly different between the strawberry and tobacco  e-liquids but plasma AUC(0→180) was significantly higher with the strawberry  e-liquid. While not significantly different, Cmax was 22% higher and various  early time point AUCs to measure rate of rise of nicotine in blood ranged  between 17 and 23% higher with the strawberry e-liquid compared to the tobacco  e-liquid. During ad libitum use, systemic exposure to nicotine (AUC(0→90)) was  the same for the tobacco and usual brand e-liquids but were both significantly  lower than after using the strawberry e-liquid. The usual flavors were more  liked and satisfying than the strawberry and tobacco e-liquids.

METHODS: Adolescents (N = 173, aged 13-18 years) who reported past-month  e-cigarette use and at least 10 lifetime uses were recruited from the San  Francisco Bay Area. The sample was 75.1% male, 54.9% non-Hispanic White, mean  age 16.6 years (standard deviation = 1.2); 26.6% reported past-month cigarette  smoking at baseline (i.e., dual use). At baseline, 6-month, and 12-month  follow-up, participants provided saliva samples for cotinine testing and  self-reported e-cigarette use frequency, dependence, past-month smoking, product  preference, and flavor preference. RESULTS: Most (80.3%) were still using e-cigarettes at 12 months, and daily use  increased from 14.5% to 29.8%.

However, scientific  studies have pointed out how e-cigs can generate carcinogens and their release  could be avoided setting the device to a low-voltage regimen. To test this  feasibility, we show the effects of e-cig vapour generated from a low-voltage  device filled with a nicotine-free liquid on rat testicular functions.

However, electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) users may be unaware of  how much they have vaped per day. The aim of this study was to test the  relationship between self-reported heaviness of ENDS/tobacco use and nicotine  biomarkers. Young adults (n = 30) who currently use ENDS and other tobacco  products completed a detailed tobacco use history, timeline follow-back, and an  ENDS topography session. We evaluated the self-reports of own-brand ENDS use and  tested correlations to determine which self-report measures of own-brand use,  and which self-reported measures of puff topography, had the strongest  correlations with urine and/or blood biomarkers of nicotine use. Participants  reported using a variety of different ENDS devices and had a range of usage. The  sum of the self-reported number of occasions or hours of ENDS use, along with  the number of cigarettes and other tobacco products used, over the past 24 hr  was significantly correlated with plasma cotinine levels. Puff topography  measures correlated with increased nicotine concentrations, although  participants underestimated the number of puffs they took during the topography  session. This study provides preliminary evidence that summing together the  hours of ENDS use, or the number of occasions of ENDS use, in addition to the  number of other tobacco products used (i.e., cigarettes) based on self-report  may be an accurate method of quantification.

"Short-term effects of electronic cigarettes on cerebrovascular function: A time 
course study.","Mills A(1), Dakhlallah D(2)(3), Robinson M(4), Kirk A(5), Llavina S(6), Boyd 
JW(6)(7), Chantler PD(4)(8), Olfert IM(1)(4)(6).",10.1113/EP090341,"NEW FINDINGS: What is the central question of this study? Acute exposure to  electronic cigarettes (Ecigs) triggers abnormal vascular responses in systemic  arteries; however, effects on cerebral vessels are poorly understood and time  for recovery is not known. We hypothesized that exposure to cigarettes or Ecigs  would trigger rapid (<4 h) impairment of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) but  that this would resolve by 24 h. What is the main finding and its importance?  Cigarettes and Ecigs caused similar degree and duration of MCA impairment. We  find it takes ~72 hours after exposure for MCA function to return to normal.  This suggests that Ecig use is likely to produce similar adverse vascular health  outcomes to those seen with cigarette smoke. ABSTRACT: Temporal influences of electronic cigarettes (Ecigs) on blood vessels  are poorly understood. In this study, we evaluated a single episode of cigarette  versus Ecig exposure on middle cerebral artery (MCA) reactivity and determined  how long after the exposure MCA responses took to return to normal. We  hypothesized that cigarette and Ecig exposure would induce rapid (<4 h)  reduction in MCA endothelial function and would resolve within 24 h.  Sprague-Dawley rats (4 months old) were exposed to either air (n = 5),  traditional cigarettes (20 puffs, n = 16) or Ecigs (20-puff group, n = 16; or  60-puff group, n = 12). Thereafter, the cigarette and Ecig groups were randomly  assigned for postexposure vessel myography testing on day 0 (D0, 1-4 h  postexposure), day 1 (D1, 24-28 h postexposure), day 2 (D2, 48-52 h  postexposure) and day 3 (72-76 h postexposure). The greatest effect on  endothelium-dependent dilatation was observed within 24 h of exposure (∼50%  decline between D0 and D1) for both cigarette and Ecig groups, and impairment  persisted with all groups for up to 3 days. Changes in endothelium-independent  dilatation responses were less severe (∼27%) and shorter lived (recovering by  D2) compared with endothelium-dependent dilatation responses. Vasoconstriction  in response to serotonin (5-HT) was similar to endothelium-independent  dilatation, with greatest impairment (∼45% for all exposure groups) at D0-D1,  returning to normal by D2. These data show that exposure to cigarettes and Ecigs  triggers a similar level/duration of cerebrovascular dysfunction after a single  exposure. The finding that Ecig (without nicotine) and cigarette (with nicotine)  exposure produce the same effects suggesting that nicotine is not likely to be  triggering MCA dysfunction, and that vaping (with/without nicotine) has  potential to produce the same vascular harm and/or disease as smoking.","Experimental, comparative study on Ec"
"Serum cotinine levels and nicotine addiction potential of e-cigarettes: an 
NHANES analysis.","Rapp JL(1), Alpert N(1), Flores RM(2), Taioli E(1)(2)(3).",10.1093/carcin/bgaa015,"This study aims to compare serum cotinine levels in e-cigarette and combustible  cigarette smokers, in an attempt to quantify the potential chronic nicotine  addiction risk that e-cigarettes pose. We analyzed 428 participants in 2015-2016  NHANES: 379 (87.03%) smoked combustible cigarettes alone and 49 (12.97%) smoked  e-cigarettes. Serum cotinine levels were measured by isotope-dilution  high-performance liquid chromatography/atmospheric pressure chemical ionization  tandem mass spectrometric method with a detection limit of 0.015 ng/ml.  Electronic cigarette smokers were younger than combustible cigarette smokers  (mean age 36.79 versus 42.69 years, P = 0.03), more likely to be male (64.93%  versus 48.32%, P = 0.09) and significantly less likely to live with other  smokers (50.17% versus 90.07%, P < 0.01). Serum cotinine levels increased  linearly with self-reported days of smoking in both electronic cigarette and  combustible cigarette smokers, after accounting for living with a smoker. The  analysis of the subgroup who reported daily use show non-statistically  significantly higher serum cotinine levels in electronic cigarette smokers  versus combustible cigarette smokers (β adj = 52.50, P = 0.10). This analysis of  recent US data demonstrates that electronic cigarettes expose users to nicotine  levels proportionate to, and potentially higher than combustible cigarettes, and  thus pose a serious risk of chronic nicotine addiction. This could be  particularly relevant in otherwise tobacco naive individuals; future risk of  tobacco-related dependence, addiction and relapse, as well as of tobacco-related  cancers in these subjects needs to be investigated.",Comparative cross-sectional observational cohort
"Electronic cigarettes containing nicotine increase endothelial and platelet 
derived extracellular vesicles in healthy volunteers.","Mobarrez F(1), Antoniewicz L(2), Hedman L(3), Bosson JA(4), Lundbäck M(5).",10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2020.02.010,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: E-cigarette use is increasingly common. Whether  e-cigarettes are harmful to human health is an intensely debated subject. In  order to investigate whether e-cigarettes with and without nicotine cause  different vascular responses, we obtained blood samples from healthy young  volunteers who performed brief active e-cigarette inhalations. Extracellular  vesicles (EVs) of endothelial and platelet origin were measured to determine  vascular changes. METHODS: Using a randomized, double-blind, crossover design, 17 healthy  occasional smokers inhaled 30 puffs of e-cigarette vapor during 30 min. Blood  samples were collected at baseline, as well as at 0, 2, 4 and 6 h post-exposure.  EVs from platelets and endothelial cells were measured by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Platelet and endothelial derived EVs were significantly increased with  peak levels seen at 4 h following exposure to active inhalation of e-cigarette  vapor with nicotine. Moreover, platelet derived EVs, expressing platelet  activation marker P-selectin and the inflammation marker, CD40 ligand, were also  significantly increased following inhalation of e-cigarette vapor with nicotine.  In addition, platelet derived EVs expressing CD40 ligand was increased after  inhalation of e-cigarette vapor without nicotine. CONCLUSION: As few as 30 puffs of nicotine-containing e-cigarette vapor caused  an increase in levels of circulating EVs of endothelial and platelet origin,  which may signify underlying vascular changes. Although e-cigarette vapor  without nicotine caused an increase in platelet EVs expressing CD40 ligand,  nicotine, as a component in the vapor, seems to have a more compelling effect on  extracellular vesicle formation and protein composition.","Randomized, double-blind crossover"

However, few in vivo studies have compared their pharmacological (pK)  efficacies, which are important for understanding their roles in the addiction  and abuse of tobacco and nicotine products. In this work, the pK of the above  nicotine salt systems was studied by subcutaneously injecting their aqueous  solutions in rats and obtaining blood samples from the jugular vein. Nicotine  levels in the blood were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. The results demonstrated that  rapid nicotine absorption occurred in all nicotine systems. Of them, NB had the  smallest Tmax , while FBN had the largest Tmax . The nicotine metabolic rate and  clearance decreased for FBN, indicating that nicotine retention in the body was  higher than for the other three salt-based systems. Compared with nicotine  salts, FBN could reach and maintain a higher concentration in the animal model.  Additionally, as the benzoic acid ratios increased, the Cmax of the nicotine  benzoate (NB) in the plasma decreased. This indicates that the lower the pH, the  lower the Cmax . When different concentrations of NB were used, the higher the  NB concentration, the greater the Cmax and AUC(0-t) . These results demonstrate  that nicotine adsorption by NB in the animal model depended on both pH and  concentration. This baseline information could be used to explain different  clinical pharmacological observations in humans, though this study only  considered the effects of nicotine on pharmacokinetics in vivo.",Comparative in vivo nicotine p
"Exposure to Toxicants Associated With Use and Transitions Between Cigarettes, 
e-Cigarettes, and No Tobacco.","Dai H(1), Benowitz NL(2), Achutan C(1), Farazi PA(1), Degarege A(1), Khan AS(1).",10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.47891,"IMPORTANCE: Transitions between e-cigarettes and cigarettes are common among  tobacco users, but empirical evidence on the health outcomes of switching  tobacco products is scarce. OBJECTIVES: To examine changes in urinary biomarkers between baseline and 1-year  follow-up among adult tobacco users switching between e-cigarettes and  cigarettes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study used data from wave 1  (baseline, September 2013 to December 2014) and wave 2 (1-year follow-up,  October 2014 to October 2015) of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health  Study. A subset of the probability sample of US adults who voluntarily provided  biospecimens at 2 waves was analyzed. Participants were divided into 3 mutually  exclusive groups at baseline: exclusive cigarette smokers, exclusive e-cigarette  users, and dual users. Data analysis was performed in 2021. EXPOSURES: Harmful and potentially harmful constituents included nicotine  metabolites, tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs; including  4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol [NNAL]), metals, polycyclic  aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Within-participant changes in 55 urinary biomarkers  of exposure (BOEs) to harmful and potentially harmful constituents were examined  using multivariable regression models. RESULTS: Among 3211 participants (55.6% women, 68.3% White, 13.2% Black, and  11.8% Hispanic) at baseline, 21.9% of exclusive cigarette users, 42.8% of  exclusive e-cigarette users, and 62.1% of dual users changed product use at  follow-up (all percentages are weighted). There was a significant reduction in  urine concentrations of TSNAs, PAHs, and VOCs when users transitioned from  exclusive cigarette to exclusive e-cigarette use, with a 92% decrease in NNAL,  from a mean of 168.4 pg/mg creatinine (95% CI, 102.3-277.1 pg/mg creatinine) to  12.9 pg/mg creatinine (95% CI, 6.4-25.7 pg/mg creatinine; P < .001). A similar  panel of BOEs decreased when dual users transitioned to exclusive e-cigarette  use; NNAL levels decreased by 96%, from a mean of 143.4 pg/mg creatinine (95%  CI, 86.7-237.0 pg/mg creatinine) to 6.3 pg/mg creatinine (95% CI, 3.5-11.4 pg/mg  creatinine; P < .001). Nicotine metabolites, TSNAs, PAHs, and VOCs significantly  increased when baseline exclusive e-cigarette users transitioned to exclusive  cigarette use or dual use. Switching from exclusive cigarette use to dual use  was not associated with significant decreases in BOEs. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This national cohort study provides evidence on the  potential harm reduction associated with transitioning from exclusive cigarette  use or dual use to exclusive e-cigarette use. e-Cigarettes tend to supplement  cigarettes through dual use instead of cessation at the population level.  Continuous monitoring of BOE at the population level and assessment of BOE  change by product transition are warranted, as well as defined adverse health  outcomes.",Cohort study on tobacco
