Stroke Epidemiology and Risk Factor Management.,"Guzik A, Bushnell C.",10.1212/CON.0000000000000416,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Death from stroke has decreased over the past decade, with  stroke now the fifth leading cause of death in the United States. In addition,  the incidence of new and recurrent stroke is declining, likely because of the  increased use of specific prevention medications, such as statins and  antihypertensives. Despite these positive trends in incidence and mortality,  many strokes remain preventable. The major modifiable risk factors are  hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco smoking, and hyperlipidemia, as well as  lifestyle factors, such as obesity, poor diet/nutrition, and physical  inactivity. This article reviews the current recommendations for the management  of each of these modifiable risk factors. RECENT FINDINGS: It has been documented that some blood pressure medications may  increase variability of blood pressure and ultimately increase the risk for  stroke. Stroke prevention typically includes antiplatelet therapy (unless an  indication for anticoagulation exists), so the most recent evidence supporting  use of these drugs is reviewed. In addition, emerging risk factors, such as  obstructive sleep apnea, electronic cigarettes, and elevated lipoprotein (a),  are discussed. SUMMARY: Overall, secondary stroke prevention includes a multifactorial  approach. This article incorporates evidence from guidelines and published  studies and uses an illustrative case study throughout the article to provide  examples of secondary prevention management of stroke risk factors.",Illustrative case-study
Effects of e-cigarettes and vaping devices on cardiac and pulmonary physiology.,"Tsai M(1), Byun MK(2)(3)(4), Shin J(2)(3), Crotty Alexander LE(2)(3).",10.1113/JP279754,"E-cigarette aerosols are exceedingly different from conventional tobacco smoke,  containing dozens of chemicals not found in cigarette smoke. It is highly likely  that chronic use of e-cigarettes will induce pathological changes in both the  heart and lungs. Here we review human and animal studies published to date and  summarize the cardiopulmonary physiological changes caused by vaping. In terms  of cardiac physiology, acute exposure to e-cigarette aerosols in human subjects  led to increased blood pressure and heart rate, similar to traditional  cigarettes. Chronic exposure to e-cigarette aerosols using animal models caused  increased arterial stiffness, vascular endothelial changes, increased  angiogenesis, cardiorenal fibrosis and increased atherosclerotic plaque  formation. Pulmonary physiology is also affected by e-cigarette aerosol  inhalation, with increased airway reactivity, airway obstruction, inflammation  and emphysema. Research thus far demonstrates that the heart and lung undergo  numerous changes in response to e-cigarette use, and disease development will  depend on how those changes combine with both environmental and genetic factors.  E-cigarettes have been advertised as a healthy alternative to cigarette smoking,  and users are under the impression that vaping of e-cigarettes is harmless, but  these claims that e-cigarettes are safer and healthier are not based on  evidence. Data from both humans and animal models are consistent in  demonstrating that vaping of e-cigarettes causes health effects both similar to  and disparate from those of cigarette smoking. Further work is needed to define  the long-term cardiopulmonary effects of e-cigarette use in humans.","Human, animal"
Electronic cigarettes: human health effects.,Callahan-Lyon P.,10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2013-051470,"OBJECTIVE: With the rapid increase in use of electronic nicotine delivery  systems (ENDS), such as electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes), users and  non-users are exposed to the aerosol and product constituents. This is a review  of published data on the human health effects of exposure to e-cigarettes and  their components. METHODS: Literature searches were conducted through September 2013 using  multiple electronic databases. RESULTS: Forty-four articles are included in this analysis. E-cigarette aerosols  may contain propylene glycol, glycerol, flavourings, other chemicals and,  usually, nicotine. Aerosolised propylene glycol and glycerol produce mouth and  throat irritation and dry cough. No data on the effects of flavouring inhalation  were identified. Data on short-term health effects are limited and there are no  adequate data on long-term effects. Aerosol exposure may be associated with  respiratory function impairment, and serum cotinine levels are similar to those  in traditional cigarette smokers. The high nicotine concentrations of some  products increase exposure risks for non-users, particularly children. The  dangers of secondhand and thirdhand aerosol exposure have not been thoroughly  evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: Scientific evidence regarding the human health effects of  e-cigarettes is limited. While e-cigarette aerosol may contain fewer toxicants  than cigarette smoke, studies evaluating whether e-cigarettes are less harmful  than cigarettes are inconclusive. Some evidence suggests that e-cigarette use  may facilitate smoking cessation, but definitive data are lacking. No  e-cigarette has been approved by FDA as a cessation aid. Environmental concerns  and issues regarding non-user exposure exist. The health impact of e-cigarettes,  for users and the public, cannot be determined with currently available data.",Literature searches
Heat-not-burn tobacco products: an emerging threat to cardiovascular health.,"Fried ND(1), Gardner JD(1).",10.1152/ajpheart.00708.2020,"Cigarette smoking is at all-time lows globally, but the use of electronic  cigarettes has increased profoundly. Recent reports of electronic cigarette or  vaping use-associated lung injury may lead individuals to explore novel methods  of nicotine consumption, such as heat-not-burn devices. IQOS from Philip Morris,  a heat-not-burn device, became available for purchase in the United States in  October 2019. Philip Morris claims that 8.8 million people have abandoned  traditional cigarettes in favor of IQOS; however, evidence suggests that it may  act as a gateway or complement to cigarette smoking, rather than a replacement.  Surveys indicate that 96% of Korean IQOS users also smoke cigarettes, and 45% of  Italian users of IQOS had never smoked cigarettes. In the United States, Canada,  and England, susceptibility of youth to trying IQOS was slightly lower than  electronic cigarettes, but higher than cigarette smoking. Heat-not-burn products  produce mainstream and second-hand emissions of harmful chemicals, including  nicotine, particulate matter, benzene, acrolein, and tobacco-specific  nitrosamines. The levels of these emissions, despite being less than those of  traditional cigarettes, are potentially harmful to cardiovascular health. A  study of current smokers showed similar acute effects of heat-not-burn tobacco  products and traditional cigarettes on heart rate, blood pressure, and arterial  stiffness. Rats exposed to IQOS had similar vascular endothelial function  impairment to those exposed to cigarettes. Heat-not-burn aerosol exposure of  cultured macrophages elicited increased oxidative stress, although less than  that induced by cigarette smoke. Further studies are needed to better understand  the cardiovascular effects of heat-not-burn tobacco products.",Study exposure
"Health effects of electronic cigarette (e‑cigarette) use on organ systems and 
its implications for public health.","Seiler-Ramadas R(1), Sandner I(2), Haider S(2), Grabovac I(2), Dorner TE(2).",10.1007/s00508-020-01711-z,"BACKGROUND: There has been growing concern over the use of electronic cigarettes  (e-cigarettes) in recent years. Although advocated as an aid to smoking  cessation, there is increasing evidence of harm not just to the respiratory  system, but to all other organs in the body. To give a clearer picture on how  e‑cigarettes can affect our health, we gathered an overview of the literature on  the various health effects of e‑cigarettes and categorized them into how they  specifically affect organ systems. E‑cigarette exposure has produced a range of  stress and inflammatory reactions in the pulmonary system, including shortness  of breath, coughing, wheezing, bronchial and pulmonary irritations, and impaired  pulmonary function. In the oral and gastrointestinal system, gingival  inflammation, sore throat, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea have been reported.  Increased tachycardia and blood pressure were reported reactions in the  cardiovascular system. In the neurological system headaches, irritability,  anxiety, dependence and insomnia were observed. Other effects included ocular  irritation, contact dermatitis, acute renal insufficiency, toxicity and  potential carcinogenicity. Nevertheless, studies have found improvements in  time-based memory and nicotine withdrawal associated with the cessation of  conventional cigarette smoking and switching to e‑cigarette use. Also, toxic and  carcinogenic metabolites were reportedly lower in e‑cigarette smokers than in  conventional cigarette smokers. CONCLUSION: A growing number of studies are showing the adverse effects caused  by e‑cigarettes on all human organ systems. Further research on the chemical  components, the diverse flavors, and the long-term effects on active and passive  users are needed to clarify the implications of e‑cigarette use on individual  and public health.",Literature review
"Fourth generation e-cigarette vaping induces transient lung inflammation and gas 
exchange disturbances: results from two randomized clinical trials.","Chaumont M(1), van de Borne P(1), Bernard A(2), Van Muylem A(3), Deprez G(4),

N(5).",10.1152/ajplung.00492.2018,"When heated by an electronic cigarette, propylene glycol and glycerol produce a  nicotine-carrying-aerosol. This hygroscopic/hyperosmolar aerosol can deposit  deep within the lung. Whether these deposits trigger local inflammation and  disturb pulmonary gas exchanges is not known. The aim of this study was to  assess the acute effects of high-wattage electronic cigarette vaping with or  without nicotine on lung inflammation biomarkers, transcutaneous gas tensions,  and pulmonary function tests in young and healthy tobacco smokers. Acute effects  of vaping without nicotine on arterial blood gas tensions were also assessed in  heavy smokers suspected of coronary artery disease. Using a single-blind  within-subjects study design, 25 young tobacco smokers underwent three  experimental sessions in random order: sham-vaping and vaping with and without  nicotine at 60 W. Twenty heavy smokers were also exposed to sham-vaping (n = 10)  or vaping without nicotine (n = 10) in an open-label, randomized parallel study.  In the young tobacco smokers, compared with sham-vaping: 1) serum club cell  protein-16 increased after vaping without nicotine (mean ± SE, -0.5 ± 0.2 vs.  +1.1 ± 0.3 µg/l, P = 0.013) and vaping with nicotine (+1.2 ± 0.3 µg/l, P =  0.009); 2) transcutaneous oxygen tension decreased for 60 min after vaping  without nicotine (nadir, -0.3 ± 1 vs. -15.3 ± 2.3 mmHg, P < 0.001) and for  80-min after vaping with nicotine (nadir, -19.6 ± 2.8 mmHg, P < 0.001). Compared  with sham vaping, vaping without nicotine decreased arterial oxygen tension for  5 min in heavy-smoking patients (+5.4 ± 3.3 vs. -5.4 ± 1.9 mmHg, P = 0.012).  Acute vaping of propylene glycol/glycerol aerosol at high wattage with or  without nicotine induces airway epithelial injury and sustained decrement in  transcutaneous oxygen tension in young tobacco smokers. Intense vaping  conditions also transiently impair arterial oxygen tension in heavy smokers.","Single-blind, randomized"
"E-cigarette, or vaping, product use associated lung injury (EVALI): case series 
and diagnostic approach.","Kalininskiy A(1), Bach CT(2), Nacca NE(3), Ginsberg G(4), Marraffa J(5), 
Navarette KA(6), McGraw MD(7), Croft DP(2).",10.1016/S2213-2600(19)30415-1,"BACKGROUND: Since June, 2019, more than 1000 new cases of e-cigarette, or  vaping, product use associated lung injury (EVALI) have been reported in the  USA. Patients presented with dyspnoea, cough, and were found to be hypoxaemic  with bilateral airspace opacities on chest imaging. Most patients required  management in the intensive care unit and steroid therapy. All patients  recovered with cessation of vaping, supportive care, and steroid therapy and  remained symptom free at follow up. E-cigarette use continues to rapidly  escalate in the USA, particularly among youth. METHODS: Cases were defined as patients admitted to the University of Rochester  Medical Center (Rochester, NY, USA) who had used e-cigarettes or another vaping  device in the 30 days before presentation, and who had bilateral airspace  opacification on chest imaging (CT or x-ray). Case details were obtained via  medical record review and patient interviews over the past 3 months including  symptomatology, physical exam data, imaging studies, laboratory data, vaping  history, and subsequent outpatient follow-up data. In collaboration with the New  York State Department of Health, our hospital developed a novel clinical  practice algorithm based on statewide physician feedback along with input from  experts in environmental health, medical toxicology, infectious disease,  epidemiology, and chronic disease prevention. FINDINGS: We report 12 cases treated for suspected EVALI at our medical centre  between June 6, 2019, and Sept 15, 2019. Ten (83%) patients had dyspnoea, fever,  and emesis and nine (75%) had cough. 11 (92%) patients reported the use of  e-cigarette cartridges containing tetrahydrocannabinol oil. Although eight (67%)  patients required admission to the intensive care unit for hypoxaemic  respiratory failure, no deaths occurred. The median hospitalisation duration was  7 days (IQR 7-8). All patients completing follow up (6 [50%]) had resolution of  previous chest CT findings and normal spirometry. The clinical algorithm focuses  on the key signs and symptoms of EVALI and the importance of ruling out  infection and other cardiopulmonary conditions before making a presumptive  diagnosis of EVALI. INTERPRETATION: Patients with suspected EVALI in our cohort had life-threatening  hypoxaemia, with 67% requiring management in the intensive care unit. Despite  the severity of presentation, similar to previous reports of patients with  EVALI, most patients improved within 1-2 weeks of initial presentation after  vaping cessation and administration of systemic corticosteroids when needed.  Almost all (92%) patients with suspected EVALI reported vaping a THC product,  making THC containing e-liquids or oils a key focus on the ongoing nationwide  investigations into the cause of EVALI. Additional research is required to  understand the potential toxins, underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, and  identification of susceptible individuals at higher risk for hospitalisation due  to EVALI. To our knowledge we present the first clinical practice algorithm for  the evaluation and management of EVALI, which will be useful for both acute  management and improved accurate reporting of this life-threatening respiratory  illness.

We hypothesized that e-cigarette use  causes changes in blood milieu that impair endothelial function. METHODS: Endothelial function was measured in chronic e-cigarette users, chronic  cigarette smokers, and nonusers. We measured effects of participants' sera, or  e-cigarette aerosol condensate, on NO and H2O2 release and cell permeability in  cultured endothelial cells (ECs). RESULTS: E-cigarette users and smokers had lower flow-mediated dilation (FMD)  than nonusers. Sera from e-cigarette users and smokers reduced VEGF (vascular  endothelial growth factor)-induced NO secretion by ECs relative to nonuser sera,  without significant reduction in endothelial NO synthase mRNA or protein levels.  E-cigarette user sera caused increased endothelial release of H2O2, and more  permeability than nonuser sera. E-cigarette users and smokers exhibited changes  in circulating biomarkers of inflammation, thrombosis, and cell adhesion  relative to nonusers, but with distinct profiles. E-cigarette user sera had  higher concentrations of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE)  ligands S100A8 and HMGB1 (high mobility group box 1) than smoker and nonuser  sera, and receptor for advanced glycation end product inhibition reduced  permeability induced by e-cigarette user sera but did not affect NO production. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic vaping and smoking both impair FMD and cause changes in the  blood that inhibit endothelial NO release. Vaping, but not smoking, causes  changes in the blood that increase microvascular endothelial permeability and  may have a vaping-specific effect on intracellular oxidative state. Our results  suggest a role for RAGE in e-cigarette-induced changes in endothelial function.",Experimental analysis
"Acute Effects of Electronic Cigarette Inhalation on the Vasculature and the 
Conducting Airways.","Antoniewicz L(1), Brynedal A(2), Hedman L(3)(4), Lundbäck M(5), Bosson JA(2).",10.1007/s12012-019-09516-x,"The use of electronic cigarettes has increased exponentially since its  introduction onto the global market in 2006. However, short- and long-term  health effects remain largely unknown due to the novelty of this product. The  present study examines the acute effects of e-cigarette aerosol inhalation, with  and without nicotine, on vascular and pulmonary function in healthy volunteers.  Seventeen healthy subjects inhaled electronic cigarette aerosol with and without  nicotine on two separate occasions in a double-blinded crossover fashion. Blood  pressure, heart rate, and arterial stiffness measured by pulse wave velocity and  pulse wave analysis were assessed at baseline, and then at 0 h, 2 h, and 4 h  following exposure. Dynamic spirometry and impulse oscillometry were measured  following vascular assessments at these time points, as well as at 6 h following  exposure. e-Cigarette aerosol with nicotine caused a significant increase in  heart rate and arterial stiffness. Furthermore, e-cigarette aerosol-containing  nicotine caused a sudden increase in flow resistance as measured by impulse  oscillometry, indicating obstruction of the conducting airways. Both aerosols  caused an increase in blood pressure. The present study indicates that inhaled  e-cigarette aerosol with nicotine has an acute impact on vascular and pulmonary  function. Thus, chronic usage may lead to long-term adverse health effects.  Further investigation is warranted.",Double-blinded crossover
Are vaporizers a lower-risk alternative to smoking cannabis?,"Chaiton M(1)(2)(3), Kundu A(4), Rueda S(5)(6)(7), Di Ciano P(5)(6)(8).",10.17269/s41997-021-00565-w,"Publisher: RéSUMé: L’usage du cannabis est associé à une panoplie de résultats  de santé physique et mentale indésirables et à un risque accru de collision  entre véhicules automobiles. De nombreux organismes, ainsi que les  « Recommandations canadiennes pour l’usage du cannabis à moindre risque »,  recommandent d’utiliser un vaporisateur au lieu de fumer le cannabis afin d’en  réduire les risques pour la santé. Notre commentaire attire l’attention sur les  preuves actuelles concernant le potentiel de réduction des méfaits du vapotage  du cannabis. L’utilisation d’un vaporisateur de cannabis peut réduire l’émission  de monoxyde de carbone, les symptômes respiratoires chroniques et l’exposition à  plusieurs toxines tout en produisant des effets subjectifs et une concentration  de THC dans le sang semblables à ceux du cannabis fumé, ce qui pourrait réduire  les méfaits chez les fumeurs réguliers de cannabis. Par contre, les nouveaux  consommateurs de cannabis, peu importe la méthode d’administration du cannabis  choisie, peuvent éprouver des effets subjectifs intenses et une détérioration  cognitive, ainsi qu’une susceptibilité accrue à la dépendance. Les responsables  des politiques devraient donc songer à limiter l’accès des jeunes au cannabis et  adopter des stratégies pour réduire la conduite avec facultés affaiblies par  cette drogue. Des études futures devraient porter sur les conséquences, pour les  fumeurs réguliers de cannabis, de vapoter l’herbe séchée à l’aide d’un  vaporisateur au lieu de fumer le cannabis, et sur les effets à long terme du  vapotage du cannabis médical, et explorer plus avant l’association entre les  lésions pulmonaires associées au vapotage et les liquides à vapoter contenant du  THC.",Narrative review
