In addition, \\nthe incidence of new and recurrent stroke is declining, likely because of the \\nincreased use of specific prevention medications, such as statins and \\nantihypertensives. Despite these positive trends in incidence and mortality, \\nmany strokes remain preventable. The major modifiable risk factors are \\nhypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco smoking, and hyperlipidemia, as well as \\nlifestyle factors, such as obesity, poor diet/nutrition, and physical \\ninactivity. This article reviews the current recommendations for the management \\nof each of these modifiable risk factors.\\nRECENT FINDINGS: It has been documented that some blood pressure medications may \\nincrease variability of blood pressure and ultimately increase the risk for \\nstroke. Stroke prevention typically includes antiplatelet therapy (unless an \\nindication for anticoagulation exists), so the most recent evidence supporting \\nuse of these drugs is reviewed. In addition, emerging risk factors, such as \\nobstructive sleep apnea, electronic cigarettes, and elevated lipoprotein (a), \\nare discussed.\\nSUMMARY: Overall, secondary stroke prevention includes a multifactorial \\napproach. This article incorporates evidence from guidelines and published \\nstudies and uses an illustrative case study throughout the article to provide \\nexamples of secondary prevention management of stroke risk factors.\\n\\nDOI: 10.1212/CON.0000000000000416\\nPMID: 28157742 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\\n\\n\\n2.

It is highly likely \\nthat chronic use of e-cigarettes will induce pathological changes in both the \\nheart and lungs. Here we review human and animal studies published to date and \\nsummarize the cardiopulmonary physiological changes caused by vaping. In terms \\nof cardiac physiology, acute exposure to e-cigarette aerosols in human subjects \\nled to increased blood pressure and heart rate, similar to traditional \\ncigarettes. Chronic exposure to e-cigarette aerosols using animal models caused \\nincreased arterial stiffness, vascular endothelial changes, increased \\nangiogenesis, cardiorenal fibrosis and increased atherosclerotic plaque \\nformation. Pulmonary physiology is also affected by e-cigarette aerosol \\ninhalation, with increased airway reactivity, airway obstruction, inflammation \\nand emphysema. Research thus far demonstrates that the heart and lung undergo \\nnumerous changes in response to e-cigarette use, and disease development will \\ndepend on how those changes combine with both environmental and genetic factors. \\nE-cigarettes have been advertised as a healthy alternative to cigarette smoking, \\nand users are under the impression that vaping of e-cigarettes is harmless, but \\nthese claims that e-cigarettes are safer and healthier are not based on \\nevidence. Data from both humans and animal models are consistent in \\ndemonstrating that vaping of e-cigarettes causes health effects both similar to \\nand disparate from those of cigarette smoking. Further work is needed to define \\nthe long-term cardiopulmonary effects of e-cigarette use in humans.\\n\\n© 2020 The Authors.
