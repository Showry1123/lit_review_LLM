Stroke Epidemiology and Risk Factor Management.

Guzik A, Bushnell C.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Death from stroke has decreased over the past decade, with 
stroke now the fifth leading cause of death in the United States. In addition, 
the incidence of new and recurrent stroke is declining, likely because of the 
increased use of specific prevention medications, such as statins and 
antihypertensives. Despite these positive trends in incidence and mortality, 
many strokes remain preventable. The major modifiable risk factors are 
hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco smoking, and hyperlipidemia, as well as 
lifestyle factors, such as obesity, poor diet/nutrition, and physical 
inactivity. This article reviews the current recommendations for the management 
of each of these modifiable risk factors.
RECENT FINDINGS: It has been documented that some blood pressure medications may 
increase variability of blood pressure and ultimately increase the risk for 
stroke. Stroke prevention typically includes antiplatelet therapy (unless an 
indication for anticoagulation exists), so the most recent evidence supporting 
use of these drugs is reviewed. In addition, emerging risk factors, such as 
obstructive sleep apnea, electronic cigarettes, and elevated lipoprotein (a), 
are discussed.
SUMMARY: Overall, secondary stroke prevention includes a multifactorial 
approach. This article incorporates evidence from guidelines and published 
studies and uses an illustrative case study throughout the article to provide 
examples of secondary prevention management of stroke risk factors.

E-cigarette aerosols are exceedingly different from conventional tobacco smoke, 
containing dozens of chemicals not found in cigarette smoke. It is highly likely 
that chronic use of e-cigarettes will induce pathological changes in both the 
heart and lungs. Here we review human and animal studies published to date and 
summarize the cardiopulmonary physiological changes caused by vaping. In terms 
of cardiac physiology, acute exposure to e-cigarette aerosols in human subjects 
led to increased blood pressure and heart rate, similar to traditional 
cigarettes. Chronic exposure to e-cigarette aerosols using animal models caused 
increased arterial stiffness, vascular endothelial changes, increased 
angiogenesis, cardiorenal fibrosis and increased atherosclerotic plaque 
formation. Pulmonary physiology is also affected by e-cigarette aerosol 
inhalation, with increased airway reactivity, airway obstruction, inflammation 
and emphysema. Research thus far demonstrates that the heart and lung undergo 
numerous changes in response to e-cigarette use, and disease development will 
depend on how those changes combine with both environmental and genetic factors. 
E-cigarettes have been advertised as a healthy alternative to cigarette smoking, 
and users are under the impression that vaping of e-cigarettes is harmless, but 
these claims that e-cigarettes are safer and healthier are not based on 
evidence. Data from both humans and animal models are consistent in 
demonstrating that vaping of e-cigarettes causes health effects both similar to 
and disparate from those of cigarette smoking. Further work is needed to define 
the long-term cardiopulmonary effects of e-cigarette use in humans.

Electronic cigarettes: human health effects.

Callahan-Lyon P.

OBJECTIVE: With the rapid increase in use of electronic nicotine delivery 
systems (ENDS), such as electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes), users and 
non-users are exposed to the aerosol and product constituents. This is a review 
of published data on the human health effects of exposure to e-cigarettes and 
their components.
METHODS: Literature searches were conducted through September 2013 using 
multiple electronic databases.
RESULTS: Forty-four articles are included in this analysis. E-cigarette aerosols 
may contain propylene glycol, glycerol, flavourings, other chemicals and, 
usually, nicotine. Aerosolised propylene glycol and glycerol produce mouth and 
throat irritation and dry cough. No data on the effects of flavouring inhalation 
were identified. Data on short-term health effects are limited and there are no 
adequate data on long-term effects. Aerosol exposure may be associated with 
respiratory function impairment, and serum cotinine levels are similar to those 
in traditional cigarette smokers. The high nicotine concentrations of some 
products increase exposure risks for non-users, particularly children. The 
dangers of secondhand and thirdhand aerosol exposure have not been thoroughly 
evaluated.
CONCLUSIONS: Scientific evidence regarding the human health effects of 
e-cigarettes is limited. While e-cigarette aerosol may contain fewer toxicants 
than cigarette smoke, studies evaluating whether e-cigarettes are less harmful 
than cigarettes are inconclusive. Some evidence suggests that e-cigarette use 
may facilitate smoking cessation, but definitive data are lacking. No 
e-cigarette has been approved by FDA as a cessation aid. Environmental concerns 
and issues regarding non-user exposure exist. The health impact of e-cigarettes, 
for users and the public, cannot be determined with currently available data.

Heat-not-burn tobacco products: an emerging threat to cardiovascular health.

New Orleans, Louisiana.

Cigarette smoking is at all-time lows globally, but the use of electronic 
cigarettes has increased profoundly. Recent reports of electronic cigarette or 
vaping use-associated lung injury may lead individuals to explore novel methods 
of nicotine consumption, such as heat-not-burn devices. IQOS from Philip Morris, 
a heat-not-burn device, became available for purchase in the United States in 
October 2019. Philip Morris claims that 8.8 million people have abandoned 
traditional cigarettes in favor of IQOS; however, evidence suggests that it may 
act as a gateway or complement to cigarette smoking, rather than a replacement. 
Surveys indicate that 96% of Korean IQOS users also smoke cigarettes, and 45% of 
Italian users of IQOS had never smoked cigarettes. In the United States, Canada, 
and England, susceptibility of youth to trying IQOS was slightly lower than 
electronic cigarettes, but higher than cigarette smoking. Heat-not-burn products 
produce mainstream and second-hand emissions of harmful chemicals, including 
nicotine, particulate matter, benzene, acrolein, and tobacco-specific 
nitrosamines. The levels of these emissions, despite being less than those of 
traditional cigarettes, are potentially harmful to cardiovascular health. A 
study of current smokers showed similar acute effects of heat-not-burn tobacco 
products and traditional cigarettes on heart rate, blood pressure, and arterial 
stiffness. Rats exposed to IQOS had similar vascular endothelial function 
impairment to those exposed to cigarettes. Heat-not-burn aerosol exposure of 
cultured macrophages elicited increased oxidative stress, although less than 
that induced by cigarette smoke. Further studies are needed to better understand 
the cardiovascular effects of heat-not-burn tobacco products.

BACKGROUND: There has been growing concern over the use of electronic cigarettes 
(e-cigarettes) in recent years. Although advocated as an aid to smoking 
cessation, there is increasing evidence of harm not just to the respiratory 
system, but to all other organs in the body. To give a clearer picture on how 
e‑cigarettes can affect our health, we gathered an overview of the literature on 
the various health effects of e‑cigarettes and categorized them into how they 
specifically affect organ systems. E‑cigarette exposure has produced a range of 
stress and inflammatory reactions in the pulmonary system, including shortness 
of breath, coughing, wheezing, bronchial and pulmonary irritations, and impaired 
pulmonary function. In the oral and gastrointestinal system, gingival 
inflammation, sore throat, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea have been reported. 
Increased tachycardia and blood pressure were reported reactions in the 
cardiovascular system. In the neurological system headaches, irritability, 
anxiety, dependence and insomnia were observed. Other effects included ocular 
irritation, contact dermatitis, acute renal insufficiency, toxicity and 
potential carcinogenicity. Nevertheless, studies have found improvements in 
time-based memory and nicotine withdrawal associated with the cessation of 
conventional cigarette smoking and switching to e‑cigarette use. Also, toxic and 
carcinogenic metabolites were reportedly lower in e‑cigarette smokers than in 
conventional cigarette smokers.
CONCLUSION: A growing number of studies are showing the adverse effects caused 
by e‑cigarettes on all human organ systems. Further research on the chemical 
components, the diverse flavors, and the long-term effects on active and passive 
users are needed to clarify the implications of e‑cigarette use on individual 
and public health.

When heated by an electronic cigarette, propylene glycol and glycerol produce a 
nicotine-carrying-aerosol. This hygroscopic/hyperosmolar aerosol can deposit 
deep within the lung. Whether these deposits trigger local inflammation and 
disturb pulmonary gas exchanges is not known. The aim of this study was to 
assess the acute effects of high-wattage electronic cigarette vaping with or 
without nicotine on lung inflammation biomarkers, transcutaneous gas tensions, 
and pulmonary function tests in young and healthy tobacco smokers. Acute effects 
of vaping without nicotine on arterial blood gas tensions were also assessed in 
heavy smokers suspected of coronary artery disease. Using a single-blind 
within-subjects study design, 25 young tobacco smokers underwent three 
experimental sessions in random order: sham-vaping and vaping with and without 
nicotine at 60 W. Twenty heavy smokers were also exposed to sham-vaping (n = 10) 
or vaping without nicotine (n = 10) in an open-label, randomized parallel study. 
In the young tobacco smokers, compared with sham-vaping: 1) serum club cell 
protein-16 increased after vaping without nicotine (mean ± SE, -0.5 ± 0.2 vs. 
+1.1 ± 0.3 µg/l, P = 0.013) and vaping with nicotine (+1.2 ± 0.3 µg/l, P = 
0.009); 2) transcutaneous oxygen tension decreased for 60 min after vaping 
without nicotine (nadir, -0.3 ± 1 vs. -15.3 ± 2.3 mmHg, P < 0.001) and for 
80-min after vaping with nicotine (nadir, -19.6 ± 2.8 mmHg, P < 0.001). Compared 
with sham vaping, vaping without nicotine decreased arterial oxygen tension for 
5 min in heavy-smoking patients (+5.4 ± 3.3 vs. -5.4 ± 1.9 mmHg, P = 0.012). 
Acute vaping of propylene glycol/glycerol aerosol at high wattage with or 
without nicotine induces airway epithelial injury and sustained decrement in 
transcutaneous oxygen tension in young tobacco smokers. Intense vaping 
conditions also transiently impair arterial oxygen tension in heavy smokers.

BACKGROUND: Since June, 2019, more than 1000 new cases of e-cigarette, or 
vaping, product use associated lung injury (EVALI) have been reported in the 
USA. Patients presented with dyspnoea, cough, and were found to be hypoxaemic 
with bilateral airspace opacities on chest imaging. Most patients required 
management in the intensive care unit and steroid therapy. All patients 
recovered with cessation of vaping, supportive care, and steroid therapy and 
remained symptom free at follow up. E-cigarette use continues to rapidly 
escalate in the USA, particularly among youth.
METHODS: Cases were defined as patients admitted to the University of Rochester 
Medical Center (Rochester, NY, USA) who had used e-cigarettes or another vaping 
device in the 30 days before presentation, and who had bilateral airspace 
opacification on chest imaging (CT or x-ray). Case details were obtained via 
medical record review and patient interviews over the past 3 months including 
symptomatology, physical exam data, imaging studies, laboratory data, vaping 
history, and subsequent outpatient follow-up data. In collaboration with the New 
York State Department of Health, our hospital developed a novel clinical 
practice algorithm based on statewide physician feedback along with input from 
experts in environmental health, medical toxicology, infectious disease, 
epidemiology, and chronic disease prevention.
FINDINGS: We report 12 cases treated for suspected EVALI at our medical centre 
between June 6, 2019, and Sept 15, 2019. Ten (83%) patients had dyspnoea, fever, 
and emesis and nine (75%) had cough. 11 (92%) patients reported the use of 
e-cigarette cartridges containing tetrahydrocannabinol oil. Although eight (67%) 
patients required admission to the intensive care unit for hypoxaemic 
respiratory failure, no deaths occurred. The median hospitalisation duration was 
7 days (IQR 7-8). All patients completing follow up (6 [50%]) had resolution of 
previous chest CT findings and normal spirometry. The clinical algorithm focuses 
on the key signs and symptoms of EVALI and the importance of ruling out 
infection and other cardiopulmonary conditions before making a presumptive 
diagnosis of EVALI.
INTERPRETATION: Patients with suspected EVALI in our cohort had life-threatening 
hypoxaemia, with 67% requiring management in the intensive care unit. Despite 
the severity of presentation, similar to previous reports of patients with 
EVALI, most patients improved within 1-2 weeks of initial presentation after 
vaping cessation and administration of systemic corticosteroids when needed. 
Almost all (92%) patients with suspected EVALI reported vaping a THC product, 
making THC containing e-liquids or oils a key focus on the ongoing nationwide 
investigations into the cause of EVALI. Additional research is required to 
understand the potential toxins, underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, and 
identification of susceptible individuals at higher risk for hospitalisation due 
to EVALI. To our knowledge we present the first clinical practice algorithm for 
the evaluation and management of EVALI, which will be useful for both acute 
management and improved accurate reporting of this life-threatening respiratory 
illness.

BACKGROUND: The harmful vascular effects of smoking are well established, but 
the effects of chronic use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) on 
endothelial function are less understood. We hypothesized that e-cigarette use 
causes changes in blood milieu that impair endothelial function.
METHODS: Endothelial function was measured in chronic e-cigarette users, chronic 
cigarette smokers, and nonusers. We measured effects of participants' sera, or 
e-cigarette aerosol condensate, on NO and H2O2 release and cell permeability in 
cultured endothelial cells (ECs).
RESULTS: E-cigarette users and smokers had lower flow-mediated dilation (FMD) 
than nonusers. Sera from e-cigarette users and smokers reduced VEGF (vascular 
endothelial growth factor)-induced NO secretion by ECs relative to nonuser sera, 
without significant reduction in endothelial NO synthase mRNA or protein levels. 
E-cigarette user sera caused increased endothelial release of H2O2, and more 
permeability than nonuser sera. E-cigarette users and smokers exhibited changes 
in circulating biomarkers of inflammation, thrombosis, and cell adhesion 
relative to nonusers, but with distinct profiles. E-cigarette user sera had 
higher concentrations of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) 
ligands S100A8 and HMGB1 (high mobility group box 1) than smoker and nonuser 
sera, and receptor for advanced glycation end product inhibition reduced 
permeability induced by e-cigarette user sera but did not affect NO production.
CONCLUSIONS: Chronic vaping and smoking both impair FMD and cause changes in the 
blood that inhibit endothelial NO release. Vaping, but not smoking, causes 
changes in the blood that increase microvascular endothelial permeability and 
may have a vaping-specific effect on intracellular oxidative state. Our results 
suggest a role for RAGE in e-cigarette-induced changes in endothelial function.

The use of electronic cigarettes has increased exponentially since its 
introduction onto the global market in 2006. However, short- and long-term 
health effects remain largely unknown due to the novelty of this product. The 
present study examines the acute effects of e-cigarette aerosol inhalation, with 
and without nicotine, on vascular and pulmonary function in healthy volunteers. 
Seventeen healthy subjects inhaled electronic cigarette aerosol with and without 
nicotine on two separate occasions in a double-blinded crossover fashion. Blood 
pressure, heart rate, and arterial stiffness measured by pulse wave velocity and 
pulse wave analysis were assessed at baseline, and then at 0 h, 2 h, and 4 h 
following exposure. Dynamic spirometry and impulse oscillometry were measured 
following vascular assessments at these time points, as well as at 6 h following 
exposure. e-Cigarette aerosol with nicotine caused a significant increase in 
heart rate and arterial stiffness. Furthermore, e-cigarette aerosol-containing 
nicotine caused a sudden increase in flow resistance as measured by impulse 
oscillometry, indicating obstruction of the conducting airways. Both aerosols 
caused an increase in blood pressure. The present study indicates that inhaled 
e-cigarette aerosol with nicotine has an acute impact on vascular and pulmonary 
function. Thus, chronic usage may lead to long-term adverse health effects. 
Further investigation is warranted.

Cannabis use is associated with various adverse physical and mental health 
outcomes as well as increased risk of motor vehicle collision. Many 
organizations and the "Lower-Risk Cannabis Use Guidelines" have recommended to 
use cannabis vaporizers instead of smoking to reduce the associated health risk. 
This commentary draws attention to the present evidence regarding harm reduction 
potential of cannabis vaping. Cannabis vaporizer use can reduce the emission of 
carbon monoxide, chronic respiratory symptoms, and exposure to several toxins 
while producing similar subjective effects and blood THC concentration compared 
with smoking cannabis, holding potential for harm reduction among habitual 
cannabis smokers. However, new cannabis users, regardless of method of 
administration of cannabis, may experience intense subjective effects and 
cognitive impairment with increased susceptibility to dependence. Hence, policy 
makers should consider limiting access to cannabis among young people and 
adopting strategies to reduce impaired driving under influence of cannabis. 
Future research should focus on impact of switching from cannabis smoking to 
dried herb vaping using cannabis vaporizers among chronic cannabis smokers, and 
long-term outcomes of medical cannabis vaping, and further explore association 
of vaping-associated lung injury with THC-containing e-liquids.

preuves actuelles concernant le potentiel de réduction des méfaits du vapotage 
du cannabis. L’utilisation d’un vaporisateur de cannabis peut réduire l’émission 
de monoxyde de carbone, les symptômes respiratoires chroniques et l’exposition à 
plusieurs toxines tout en produisant des effets subjectifs et une concentration 
de THC dans le sang semblables à ceux du cannabis fumé, ce qui pourrait réduire 
les méfaits chez les fumeurs réguliers de cannabis. Par contre, les nouveaux 
consommateurs de cannabis, peu importe la méthode d’administration du cannabis 
choisie, peuvent éprouver des effets subjectifs intenses et une détérioration 
cognitive, ainsi qu’une susceptibilité accrue à la dépendance. Les responsables 
des politiques devraient donc songer à limiter l’accès des jeunes au cannabis et 
adopter des stratégies pour réduire la conduite avec facultés affaiblies par 
cette drogue. Des études futures devraient porter sur les conséquences, pour les 
fumeurs réguliers de cannabis, de vapoter l’herbe séchée à l’aide d’un 
vaporisateur au lieu de fumer le cannabis, et sur les effets à long terme du 
vapotage du cannabis médical, et explorer plus avant l’association entre les 
lésions pulmonaires associées au vapotage et les liquides à vapoter contenant du 
THC.

Update of
    Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2021 Apr 29;4:CD010216.

BACKGROUND: Electronic cigarettes (ECs) are handheld electronic vaping devices 
which produce an aerosol formed by heating an e-liquid. Some people who smoke 
use ECs to stop or reduce smoking, but some organizations, advocacy groups and 
policymakers have discouraged this, citing lack of evidence of efficacy and 
safety. People who smoke, healthcare providers and regulators want to know if 
ECs can help people quit and if they are safe to use for this purpose. This is 
an update conducted as part of a living systematic review.
OBJECTIVES: To examine the effectiveness, tolerability, and safety of using 
electronic cigarettes (ECs) to help people who smoke tobacco achieve long-term 
smoking abstinence.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's Specialized 
Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, 
Embase, and PsycINFO to 1 May 2021, and reference-checked and contacted study 
authors. We screened abstracts from the Society for Research on Nicotine and 
Tobacco (SRNT) 2021 Annual Meeting.   SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs) and randomized cross-over trials, in which people who 
smoke were randomized to an EC or control condition. We also included 
uncontrolled intervention studies in which all participants received an EC 
intervention. Studies had to report abstinence from cigarettes at six months or 
longer or data on safety markers at one week or longer, or both.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We followed standard Cochrane methods for 
screening and data extraction. Our primary outcome measures were abstinence from 
smoking after at least six months follow-up, adverse events (AEs), and serious 
adverse events (SAEs). Secondary outcomes included the proportion of people 
still using study product (EC or pharmacotherapy) at six or more months after 
randomization or starting EC use, changes in carbon monoxide (CO), blood 
pressure (BP), heart rate, arterial oxygen saturation, lung function, and levels 
of carcinogens or toxicants or both. We used a fixed-effect Mantel-Haenszel 
model to calculate risk ratios (RRs) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) for 
dichotomous outcomes. For continuous outcomes, we calculated mean differences. 
Where appropriate, we pooled data in meta-analyses.
MAIN RESULTS: We included 61 completed studies, representing 16,759 
participants, of which 34 were RCTs. Five of the 61 included studies were new to 
this review update. Of the included studies, we rated seven (all contributing to 
our main comparisons) at low risk of bias overall, 42 at high risk overall 
(including all non-randomized studies), and the remainder at unclear risk. There 
was moderate-certainty evidence, limited by imprecision, that quit rates were 
higher in people randomized to nicotine EC than in those randomized to nicotine 
replacement therapy (NRT) (risk ratio (RR) 1.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 
1.21 to 1.93; I2 = 0%; 4 studies, 1924 participants). In absolute terms, this 
might translate to an additional three quitters per 100 (95% CI 1 to 6). There 
was low-certainty evidence (limited by very serious imprecision) that the rate 
of occurrence of AEs was similar (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.19; I2 = 0%; 2 
studies, 485 participants). SAEs were rare, but there was insufficient evidence 
to determine whether rates differed between groups due to very serious 
imprecision (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.90: I2 = 0; 4 studies, 1424 
participants). There was moderate-certainty evidence, again limited by 
imprecision, that quit rates were higher in people randomized to nicotine EC 
than to non-nicotine EC (RR 1.94, 95% CI 1.21 to 3.13; I2 = 0%; 5 studies, 1447 
participants). In absolute terms, this might lead to an additional seven 
quitters per 100 (95% CI 2 to 16). There was moderate-certainty evidence of no 
difference in the rate of AEs between these groups (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.91 to 
1.11; I2 = 0%; 3 studies, 601 participants). There was insufficient evidence to 
determine whether rates of SAEs differed between groups, due to very serious 
imprecision (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.38; I2 = 0; 5 studies, 792 participants). 
Compared to behavioural support only/no support, quit rates were higher for 
participants randomized to nicotine EC (RR 2.61, 95% CI 1.44 to 4.74; I2 = 0%; 6 
studies, 2886 participants). In absolute terms this represents an additional six 
quitters per 100 (95% CI 2 to 15). However, this finding was of very low 
certainty, due to issues with imprecision and risk of bias. There was some 
evidence that non-serious AEs were more common in people randomized to nicotine 
EC (RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.32; I2 = 41%, low certainty; 4 studies, 765 
participants), and again, insufficient evidence to determine whether rates of 
SAEs differed between groups (RR 1.51, 95% CI 0.70 to 3.24; I2 = 0%; 7 studies, 
1303 participants).  Data from non-randomized studies were consistent with RCT 
data. The most commonly reported AEs were throat/mouth irritation, headache, 
cough, and nausea, which tended to dissipate with continued use. Very few 
studies reported data on other outcomes or comparisons, hence evidence for these 
is limited, with CIs often encompassing clinically significant harm and benefit.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is moderate-certainty evidence that ECs with 
nicotine increase quit rates compared to NRT and compared to ECs without 
nicotine. Evidence comparing nicotine EC with usual care/no treatment also 
suggests benefit, but is less certain. More studies are needed to confirm the 
effect size. Confidence intervals were for the most part wide for data on AEs, 
SAEs and other safety markers, with no difference in AEs between nicotine and 
non-nicotine ECs. Overall incidence of SAEs was low across all study arms. We 
did not detect  evidence of harm from nicotine EC, but longest follow-up was two 
years and the  number of studies was small. The main limitation of the evidence 
base remains imprecision due to the small number of RCTs, often with low event 
rates, but further RCTs are underway. To ensure the review continues to provide 
up-to-date information to decision-makers, this review is now a living 
systematic review. We run searches monthly, with the review updated when 
relevant new evidence becomes available. Please refer to the Cochrane Database 
of Systematic Reviews for the review's current status.

Acute tobacco cigarette (TC) smoking increases blood pressure and sympathetic 
nerve activity, whereas there are scarce data on the impact of electronic 
cigarette (EC) smoking. We assessed the acute effects of TC, EC and sham smoking 
on blood pressure, heart rate and sympathetic nervous system. Methods: We 
studied 12 normotensive male habitual smokers (mean age 33 years) free of 
cardiovascular disease. The study design was randomized and sham controlled with 
three experimental sessions (sham smoking, TC smoking and EC smoking). After 
baseline measurements at rest, the subjects were then asked to smoke (puffing 
habits left uncontrolled) two TC cigarettes containing 1.1 mg nicotine, EC 
smoking or simulated smoking with a drinking straw with a filter (sham smoking), 
in line with previous methodology. Results: EC smoking at 5 and 30 min compared 
to baseline was accompanied by the augmentation of mean arterial pressure (MAP) 
and heart rate (p < 0.001 for all). The muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) 
decrease was significant during both TC and EC sessions (p < 0.001 for both 
comparisons) and was similar between them (−25.1% ± 9.8% vs. −34.4% ± 8.3%, 
respectively, p = 0.018). Both MSNA decreases were significantly higher (p < 
0.001 for both comparisons) than that elicited by sham smoking (−4.4% ± 4.8%). 
Skin sympathetic nerve activity increase was significant in both TC and EC 
groups (p < 0.001 for both comparisons) and similar between them (73.4% ± 17.9% 
and 71.9% ± 7%, respectively, p = 0.829). Conclusions: The unfavorable responses 
of sympathetic and arterial pressure to EC smoking are similar to those elicited 
by TC in healthy habitual smokers.

this review update. Of the included studies, we rated five (all contributing to 
our main comparisons) at low risk of bias overall, 41 at high risk overall 
(including the 25 non-randomized studies), and the remainder at unclear risk. 
There was moderate-certainty evidence, limited by imprecision, that quit rates 
were higher in people randomized to nicotine EC than in those randomized to 
nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) (risk ratio (RR) 1.69, 95% confidence 
interval (CI) 1.25 to 2.27; I2 = 0%; 3 studies, 1498 participants). In absolute 
terms, this might translate to an additional four successful quitters per 100 
(95% CI 2 to 8). There was low-certainty evidence (limited by very serious 
imprecision) that the rate of occurrence of AEs was similar) (RR 0.98, 95% CI 
0.80 to 1.19; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 485 participants). SAEs occurred rarely, with 
no evidence that their frequency differed between nicotine EC and NRT, but very 
serious imprecision led to low certainty in this finding (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.77 
to 2.41: I2 = n/a; 2 studies, 727 participants). There was moderate-certainty 
evidence, again limited by imprecision, that quit rates were higher in people 
randomized to nicotine EC than to non-nicotine EC (RR 1.70, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.81; 
I2 = 0%; 4 studies, 1057 participants). In absolute terms, this might again lead 
to an additional four successful quitters per 100 (95% CI 0 to 11). These trials 
mainly used older EC with relatively low nicotine delivery. There was 
moderate-certainty evidence of no difference in the rate of AEs between these 
groups (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.11; I2 = 0%; 3 studies, 601 participants). 
There was insufficient evidence to determine whether rates of SAEs differed 
between groups, due to very serious imprecision (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.44; 
I2 = n/a; 4 studies, 494 participants). Compared to behavioral support only/no 
support, quit rates were higher for participants randomized to nicotine EC (RR 
2.70, 95% CI 1.39 to 5.26; I2 = 0%; 5 studies, 2561 participants). In absolute 
terms this represents an increase of seven per 100 (95% CI 2 to 17). However, 
this finding was of very low certainty, due to issues with imprecision and risk 
of bias. There was no evidence that the rate of SAEs differed, but some evidence 
that non-serious AEs were more common in people randomized to nicotine EC (AEs: 
RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.32; I2 = 41%, low certainty; 4 studies, 765 
participants; SAEs: RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.33 to 4.09; I2 = 5%; 6 studies, 1011 
participants, very low certainty). Data from non-randomized studies were 
consistent with RCT data. The most commonly reported AEs were throat/mouth 
irritation, headache, cough, and nausea, which tended to dissipate with 
continued use. Very few studies reported data on other outcomes or comparisons 
and hence evidence for these is limited, with confidence intervals often

AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is moderate-certainty evidence that ECs with 
nicotine increase quit rates compared to ECs without nicotine and compared to 
NRT. Evidence comparing nicotine EC with usual care/no treatment also suggests 
benefit, but is less certain. More studies are needed to confirm the size of 
effect, particularly when using modern EC products. Confidence intervals were 
for the most part wide for data on AEs, SAEs and other safety markers, though 
evidence indicated no difference in AEs between nicotine and non-nicotine ECs. 
Overall incidence of SAEs was low across all study arms. We did not detect any

AIMS: The electronic cigarette is marketed as a safe alternative to tobacco 
smoking, but electronic cigarette cardiovascular effects remain largely unknown. 
We systematically reviewed and meta-analysed published literature to investigate 
the cardiovascular effects and associated risk from electronic cigarette use.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We searched PubMed from January 2000 to November 2017 for 
published studies assessing the cardiovascular effects of the electronic 
cigarette. Evidence suggests that the electronic cigarette negatively affects 
endothelial function, arterial stiffness and the long-term risk for coronary 
events, but these findings are from single study reports and have not been 
confirmed in additional studies. Conflicting evidence exists on the effects of 
the electronic cigarette on heart rate and blood pressure, which is mainly based 
on non-randomized clinical studies of moderate quality. The meta-analysis of 14 
studies (N + 441 participants) suggested that despite the negative acute effects 
of the electronic cigarette on heart rate (pooled mean difference (MD) + 2.27, 
95% confidence interval (CI): 1.64 to 2.89, p < 0.001), diastolic (pooled 
MD + 2.01 mmHg, 95% CI: 0.62 to 3.39, p + 0.004) and systolic blood pressure 
(pooled MD + 2.02 mmHg, 95% CI: 0.07 to 3.97, p + 0.042), benefits may be 
observed in terms of blood pressure regulation when switching from tobacco 
smoking to chronic electronic cigarette use (systolic blood pressure pooled 
MD + -7.00, 95% CI: -9.63 to -4.37, p < 0.001; diastolic blood pressure pooled 
MD + -3.65, 95% CI: -5.71 to -1.59, p + 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The existing evidence on the cardiovascular effects of the 
electronic cigarette is concerning, with several unexplored issues. Unless 
supported by stronger evidence, the electronic cigarette should not be labelled 
as a cardiovascular safe product. Future studies should delineate whether 
electronic cigarette use is less hazardous to cardiovascular health than 
conventional cigarette smoking.

BACKGROUND: E-cigarette (EC) use is increasing exponentially worldwide. The 
early cardiovascular effects of switching from tobacco cigarettes (TC) to EC in 
chronic smokers is unknown. Meta-analysis of flow-mediated dilation (FMD) 
studies indicate 13% lower pooled, adjusted relative risks of cardiovascular 
events with every 1% improvement in FMD.
OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine the early vascular impact of 
switching from TC to EC in chronic smokers.
METHODS: The authors conducted a prospective, randomized control trial with a 
parallel nonrandomized preference cohort and blinded endpoint of smokers ≥18 
years of age who had smoked ≥15 cigarettes/day for ≥2 years and were free from 
established cardiovascular disease. Participants were randomized to EC with 
nicotine or EC without nicotine for 1 month. Those unwilling to quit continued 
with TC in a parallel preference arm. A propensity score analysis was done to 
adjust for differences between the randomized and preference arms. Vascular 
function was assessed by FMD and pulse wave velocity. Compliance with EC was 
measured by carbon monoxide levels.
RESULTS: Within 1 month of switching from TC to EC, there was a significant 
improvement in endothelial function (linear trend β = 0.73%; 95% confidence 
interval [CI]: 0.41 to 1.05; p < 0.0001; TC vs. EC combined: 1.49%; 95% CI: 0.93 
to 2.04; p < 0.0001) and vascular stiffness (-0.529 m/s; 95% CI: -0.946 
to -0.112; p = 0.014). Females benefited from switching more than males did in 
every between-group comparison. Those who complied best with EC switch 
demonstrated the largest improvement. There was no difference in vascular 
effects between EC with and without nicotine within the study timeframe.
CONCLUSIONS: TC smokers, particularly females, demonstrate significant 
improvement in vascular health within 1 month of switching from TC to EC. 
Switching from TC to EC may be considered a harms reduction measure.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: E-cigarettes (e-cigs) release toxic chemicals known to 
increase blood pressure (BP) levels. The effects of e-cigs on BP, however, 
remain unknown. Studying BP may help characterize potential cardiovascular risks 
of short- and long-term e-cig use. We summarized published studies on the 
association of e-cig use with BP endpoints.
RECENT FINDINGS: Thirteen e-cig trials (12 cross-over designs) and 1 
observational study evaluated systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and 
DBP). All trials included at least one e-cig arm with nicotine, 6 a no-nicotine 
e-cig arm, and 3 a placebo arm. SBP/DBP increased in most nicotine e-cig arms, 
in some non-nicotine e-cig arms, and in none of the placebo arms. The 
observational study followed e-cig users and nonsmokers for 3.5 years with 
inconsistent findings. The use of e-cigs with and without nicotine may result in 
short-term elevations of both SBP and DBP. Prospective studies that investigate 
the long-term cardiovascular impact of e-cig use are needed.

Electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use has grown substantially since inception, 
particularly among adolescents and combustible tobacco users. Several cigarette 
smoke constituents with known neurovascular effect are present in e-cigarette 
liquids or formed during the vapor generation. The present study establishes 
inhaled models of cigarette and e-cigarette use with normalized nicotine 
delivery, then characterizes the impact on blood-brain barrier (BBB) function. 
Sequencing of microvessel RNA following exposure revealed downregulation of 
several genes with critical roles in BBB function. Reduced protein expression of 
Occludin and Glut1 is also observed at the tight junction in all groups 
following exposure. Pro-inflammatory changes in leukocyte-endothelial cell 
interaction are also noted, and mice exposed to nicotine-free e-cigarettes have 
impaired novel object recognition performance. On this basis, it is concluded 
that long term e-cigarette use may adversely impact neurovascular health. The 
observed effects are noted to be partly independent of nicotine content and 
nicotine may even serve to moderate the effects of non-nicotinic components on 
the blood-brain barrier.

The prevalence of vaping has overtaken conventional cigarettes as the most 
frequent form of nicotine consumption among 15-24-year olds. There are currently 
a large number of both legitimate and illegitimate products and suppliers 
offering more than 8000 different flavors of vape on the market, whose additives 
are not tested, studied or regulated and whose safety and toxicity profile 
remains unknown. In vitro studies have demonstrated a dose-dependent decrease in 
the viability of normal human bronchial epithelial cells after exposure to vapor 
from electronic vape devices.Short- and medium-term studies to date indicate 
that vapor-induced pulmonary lesions are the most serious and commonly reported 
side effect; such lesions include bilateral ground glass opacities in lung bases 
with subpleural preservation, bilateral infiltrates, pleural effusion, 
pneumomediastinum and nodular opacities. Cases of EVALI have been described in 
patients with daily exposure, as well as in users who reported having been 
exposed to these substances at least once a month. The most frequently inhaled 
substances are THC, flavored liquids of unknown content, and nicotine.The 
clinical manifestations of dyspnea and cough are the most frequent respiratory 
symptomatology, in addition to constitutional manifestations such as fever and 
chills, and gastrointestinal manifestations such as vomiting, nausea, abdominal 
pain and diarrhea. To these can be added the presence of tachypnea, tachycardia, 
elevated blood pressure, hypoxia, leukocytosis with neutrophilia and elevated 
ESR.

Publisher: Das Dampfen hat die herkömmlichen Zigaretten als häufigste Form des 
Nikotinkonsums bei den 15- bis 24-Jährigen überholt. Derzeit gibt es auf dem 
Markt eine Vielzahl von legalen und illegalen Produkten und Anbietern, die mehr 
als 8000 verschiedene Geschmacksrichtungen anbieten, deren Zusatzstoffe nicht 
getestet, untersucht oder reguliert werden und deren Sicherheits- und 
Toxizitätsprofil unbekannt bleibt. In-vitro-Studien haben eine dosisabhängige 
Abnahme der Lebensfähigkeit normaler menschlicher Bronchialepithelzellen nach 
Exposition gegenüber Dampf aus elektronischen Verdampfungsgeräten 
gezeigt.Bisherige kurz- und mittelfristige Studien deuten darauf hin, dass 
dampfinduzierte Lungenläsionen die schwerwiegendste und am häufigsten gemeldete 
Nebenwirkung sind. Zu diesen Läsionen gehören: bilaterale Mattigkeit in der 
Lungenbasis mit subpleuralem Erhalt, bilaterale Infiltrate, Pleuraerguss, 
Pneumomediastinum und knotige Trübungen. Fälle von EVALI wurden sowohl bei 
Patienten mit täglicher Exposition als auch bei Anwendern beschrieben, die 
angaben, diesen Substanzen mindestens einmal im Monat ausgesetzt gewesen zu 
sein. Die am häufigsten inhalierten Substanzen sind THC, aromatisierte 
Flüssigkeiten mit unbekanntem Inhalt und Nikotin.Die klinischen Manifestationen 
von Dyspnoe und Husten sind die häufigsten respiratorischen Symptome, zusätzlich 
zu anderen konstitutionellen Manifestationen wie Fieber und Schüttelfrost und 
anderen gastrointestinalen Manifestationen wie Erbrechen, Übelkeit, 
Bauchschmerzen und Durchfall; hinzu kommt das Vorhandensein von Tachypnoe, 
Tachykardie, erhöhtem Blutdruck, Hypoxie, Leukozytose mit Neutrophilie und 
erhöhter ESR.

Introduction: Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are a rapidly evolving class 
of tobacco products intended to deliver nicotine to users. There are many types 
of e-cigarettes available and the most popular type today in the United States 
are 'pod' based devices that use high nicotine concentration liquids. 
Understanding the nicotine delivery capabilities of e-cigarettes is imperative 
for understanding their addictive potential and safety profile, informing 
regulation, and revealing their potential use as smoking cessation aids. Areas 
covered: This review discusses nicotine content of e-cigarettes, effectiveness 
of nicotine aerosolization by devices, delivery of nicotine to users, and user 
and device characteristics that impact each of these. Expert opinion: Modern 
e-cigarettes have the potential to deliver equal or more nicotine compared to a 
tobacco cigarette. Future research needs to identify the nicotine delivery 
profiles likely to benefit public health and the means to regulate them 
appropriately while also identifying those that are likely to cause harm. Public 
health benefit accrues if e-cigarettes help smokers quit combustible cigarettes 
completely. Harm is possible if inadequate nicotine delivery undermines 
cessation attempts, e-cigarettes facilitate continued combustible cigarette use, 
long-term e-cigarette use is associated with substantial morbidity/mortality, 
and/or e-cigarettes increase the initiation of combustible cigarette use among 
never smokers.

Previous studies in our laboratory have shown that nicotine exposure decreases 
glucose transport across the blood-brain barrier in ischemia-reperfusion 
conditions. We hypothesize that nicotine can also dysregulate brain parenchymal 
glucose utilization by altering glucose transporters with effects on sensitivity 
to ischemic stroke. In this study, we investigated the effects of nicotine 
exposure on neuronal glucose utilization using an in vitro ischemic stroke 
model. We also tested the effects of e-Cig vaping on ischemic brain glucose 
utilization using an acute brain slice technique. Primary cortical neurons and 
brain slices were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation followed by 
reoxygenation to mimic ischemia-reperfusion injury. We estimated brain cell 
glucose utilization by measuring the uptake of [3 H] deoxy-d-glucose. 
Immunofluorescence and western blotting were done to characterize glucose 
transporters (GLUTs) and α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) expression. 
Furthermore, we used a glycolytic stress test to measure the effects of nicotine 
exposure on neuronal glucose metabolism. We observed that short- and long-term 
nicotine/cotinine exposure significantly decreased neuronal glucose utilization 
in ischemic conditions and the non-specific nAChR antagonist, mecamylamine 
reversed this effect. Nicotine/cotinine exposure also decreased neuronal GLUT1 
and up-regulated α7 nAChR expression and decreased glycolysis. Exposure of mice 
to e-Cig vapor for 7 days likewise decreases brain glucose uptake under normoxic 
and ischemic conditions along with down-regulation of GLUT1 and GLUT3 
expressions. These data support, from a cerebrovascular perspective, that 
nicotine and/or e-Cig vaping induce a state of glucose deprivation at the 
neurovascular unit which could lead to enhanced ischemic brain injury and/or 
stroke risk. OPEN PRACTICES: Open Science: This manuscript was awarded with the

Evidence in humans suggests a correlation between nicotine smoking and severe 
respiratory symptoms with COVID-19 infection. In lung tissue, 
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) appears to mechanistically underlie viral 
entry. Here, we investigated whether e-cigarette vapor inhalation alters ACE2 
and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) expression in male and female mice. 
In male lung, nicotine vapor inhalation induced a significant increase in ACE2 
mRNA and protein, but surprisingly, these differences were not found in females. 
Further, both vehicle and nicotine vapor inhalation downregulated α5 nAChR 
subunits in both sexes, while differences were not found in α7 nAChR subunit 
expression. Finally, blood ACE2 levels did not differ with exposure, indicating 
that blood sampling is not a sufficient indicator of lung ACE2 changes. 
Together, these data indicate a direct link between e-cigarette vaping and 
increased ACE2 expression in male lung tissue, which thereby reveals an 
underlying mechanism of increased vulnerability to coronavirus infection in 
individuals vaping nicotine.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: With high rates of use and uncertain consequences, 
valid electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use frequency and addiction measures 
for adolescents are needed. This cross-sectional study examined correlations for 
multiple measures of adolescent e-cigarette use with nicotine exposure 
quantified with salivary cotinine levels.
METHODS: Adolescents (N=173, age 13-18) who reported past-month e-cigarette use 
were recruited from the San Francisco Bay Area. Participants self-reported: (1) 
days of e-cigarette use in a typical month, (2) number of e-cigarette sessions 
in a typical day (sessions per day; SPD) and the (3) E-Cigarette Addiction 
Severity Index (EASI). Participants also completed the 10-item Penn State 
Electronic Cigarette Dependence Index (ECDI), which we examined in full and as a 
2-item Heaviness of Vaping Index (HVI; the sum of the ECDI items on use 
frequency and time to first vaping on wakening). Sessions per month (SPM) were 
calculated using days per month and SPD. Cotinine levels, SPD and SPM were 
log-transformed.
RESULTS: Among frequency measures, SPM correlated most strongly with cotinine 
(r=0.59), followed closely by days per month (r=0.58) and SPD (r=0.57), p<0.001. 
Among dependence measures, the EASI correlated most strongly with cotinine 
(r=0.51), closely followed by the ECDI and HVI (r's=0.50), all p's<0.001.
CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents' reports of frequency of e-cigarette use and degree of 
addiction correlated significantly with cotinine as a biomarker of nicotine 
exposure. We recommend the EASI and days per month as brief general measures. 
SPM and the ECDI are more extensive measures that may yield a more nuanced 
understanding of use.

Electronic cigarette (EC) vaping is increasingly popular, despite growing 
evidence of adverse health effects. To further evaluate the impact of EC use on 
vascular health, we investigated the effects of brief EC inhalation on 
flow-dependent thrombus formation and microcirculation in healthy volunteers. 
The study was performed with a randomised double-blind crossover design. 
Twenty-two healthy subjects aged between 18 and 45 years with occasional tobacco 
use were recruited. Subjects inhaled 30 puffs of EC aerosol with and without 
nicotine on two occasions separated by a wash-out period of at least 1 week. 
Blood samples were collected at baseline and at 15 and 60 min following exposure 
and analysed with the Total-Thrombus-formation analysis system evaluating 
fibrin-rich thrombus formation and platelet thrombus formation in whole blood 
under flow. Microvascular function was assessed at baseline and 30 min after 
exposure by laser speckle contrast imaging and iontophoresis of acetylcholine 
and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) to evaluate the endothelium-dependent and 
independent pathways of vasodilation. Compared with nicotine free EC aerosol, 
exposure to EC aerosol with nicotine significantly increased platelet thrombus 
formation and fibrin-rich thrombus formation at 15 min (p = 0.017 and p = 0.037, 
respectively) with normalisation after 60 min. Peak SNP-mediated microvascular 
perfusion, i.e. endothelium-independent vasodilation, was reduced following EC 
vaping with nicotine compared with baseline (p = 0.006). Thirty puffs of EC 
aerosol with nicotine increased platelet and fibrin-dependent thrombus formation 
and reduced microvascular dilatation capacity. No compelling effects of EC 
vaping without nicotine were observed, indicating nicotine as the main effector.

The microbiome has increasingly been linked to cancer. Little is known about the 
lung and oral cavity microbiomes in smokers, and even less for electronic 
cigarette (EC) users, compared with never-smokers. In a cross-sectional study (n 
= 28) of smokers, EC users, and never-smokers, bronchoalveolar lavage and saliva 
samples underwent metatranscriptome profiling to examine associations with lung 
and oral microbiomes. Pairwise comparisons assessed differentially abundant 
bacteria species. Total bacterial load was similar between groups, with no 
differences in bacterial diversity across lung microbiomes. In lungs, 44 
bacteria species differed significantly (FDR < 0.1) between 
smokers/never-smokers, with most decreased in smokers. Twelve species differed 
between smokers/EC users, all decreased in smokers of which Neisseria sp. KEM232 
and Curvibacter sp. AEP1-3 were observed. Among the top five decreased species 
in both comparisons, Neisseria elongata, Neisseria sicca, and Haemophilus 
parainfluenzae were observed. In the oral microbiome, 152 species were 
differentially abundant for smokers/never-smokers, and 17 between 
smokers/electronic cigarette users, but only 21 species were differentially 
abundant in both the lung and oral cavity. EC use is not associated with changes 
in the lung microbiome compared with never-smokers, indicating EC toxicity does 
not affect microbiota. Statistically different bacteria in smokers compared with 
EC users and never-smokers were almost all decreased, potentially due to toxic 
effects of cigarette smoke. The low numbers of overlapping oral and lung 
microbes suggest that the oral microbiome is not a surrogate for analyzing 
smoking-related effects in the lung.
PREVENTION RELEVANCE: The microbiome affects cancer and other disease risk. The 
effects of e-cig usage on the lung microbiome are essentially unknown. Given the 
importance of lung microbiome dysbiosis populated by oral species which have 
been observed to drive lung cancer progression, it is important to study effects 
of e-cig use on microbiome.

The use of traditional tobacco products is a known risk factor for the 
development of diseases including periodontal disease. To date, the potential 
oral health effects related to electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) use 
is unknown. This study collected saliva from ENDS users and never tobacco users 
to examine differences in the oral cavity of inflammatory cytokines and 
metabolites. The identification and measurement of these ENDS-related changes 
provide insight into disease pathways potentially associated with ENDS use. The 
utilization of saliva samples collected from human participates enhances the 
application of the findings compared to the majority of studies using cell 
culture and animal models. In addition, these foundational findings can inform 
future studies to examining specific pathways identified, interventional 
approaches, and application of translatable biomarkers of ENDS use.

, Rockville, Maryland, USA.

OBJECTIVE: To review the available literature evaluating electronic cigarette 
(e-cigarette) nicotine clinical pharmacology in order to understand the 
potential impact of e-cigarettes on individual users, nicotine dependence and 
public health.
METHODS: Literature searches were conducted between 1 October 2012 and 30 
September 2013 using key terms in five electronic databases. Studies were 
included in the review if they were in English and publicly available; 
non-clinical studies, conference abstracts and studies exclusively measuring 
nicotine content in e-cigarette cartridges were excluded from the review.
RESULTS: Nicotine yields from automated smoking machines suggest that 
e-cigarettes deliver less nicotine per puff than traditional cigarettes, and 
clinical studies indicate that e-cigarettes deliver only modest nicotine 
concentrations to the inexperienced e-cigarette user. However, current 
e-cigarette smokers are able to achieve systemic nicotine and/or cotinine 
concentrations similar to those produced from traditional cigarettes. Therefore, 
user experience is critically important for nicotine exposure, and may 
contribute to the products' ability to support and maintain nicotine dependence.
CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge about e-cigarette nicotine pharmacology remains limited. 
Because a user's e-cigarette experience may significantly impact nicotine 
delivery, future nicotine pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies should be 
conducted in experienced users to accurately assess the products' impact on 
public health.

After more than a decade of electronic cigarette (E-cig) use in the United 
States, uncertainty persists regarding E-cig use and long-term cardiopulmonary 
disease risk. As all E-cigs use propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin (PG-VG) 
and generate abundant saturated aldehydes, mice were exposed by inhalation to 
PG-VG-derived aerosol, formaldehyde (FA), acetaldehyde (AA), or filtered air. 
Biomarkers of exposure and cardiopulmonary injury were monitored by mass 
spectrometry (urine metabolites), radiotelemetry (respiratory reflexes), 
isometric myography (aorta), and flow cytometry (blood markers). Acute PG-VG 
exposure significantly affected multiple biomarkers including pulmonary reflex 
(decreased respiratory rate, -50%), endothelium-dependent relaxation 
(-61.8 ± 4.2%), decreased WBC (-47 ± 7%), and, increased RBC (+6 ± 1%) and 
hemoglobin (+4 ± 1%) versus air control group. Notably, FA exposure 
recapitulated the prominent effects of PG-VG aerosol on pulmonary irritant 
reflex and endothelial dysfunction, whereas AA exposure did not. To attempt to 
link PG-VG exposure with FA or AA exposure, urinary formate and acetate levels 
were measured by GC-MS. Although neither FA nor AA exposure altered excretion of 
their primary metabolite, formate or acetate, respectively, compared with 
air-exposed controls, PG-VG aerosol exposure significantly increased 
post-exposure urinary acetate but not formate. These data suggest that E-cig use 
may increase cardiopulmonary disease risk independent of the presence of 
nicotine and/or flavorings. This study indicates that FA levels in tobacco 
product-derived aerosols should be regulated to levels that do not induce 
biomarkers of cardiopulmonary harm. There remains a need for reliable biomarkers 
of exposure to inhaled FA and AA.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Use of electronic cigarettes 
(E-cig) induces endothelial dysfunction (ED) in healthy humans, yet the specific 
constituents in E-cig aerosols that contribute to ED are unknown. Our study 
implicates formaldehyde that is formed in heating of E-cig solvents (propylene 
glycol, PG; vegetable glycerin, VG). Exposure to formaldehyde or PG-VG-derived 
aerosol alone stimulated ED in female mice. As ED was independent of nicotine 
and flavorants, these data reflect a "universal flaw" of E-cigs that use 
PG-VG.Listen to this article's corresponding podcast at

Serious adverse health effects have been reported with the use of vaping 
products, including neurologic disorders and e-cigarette or vaping product 
use-associated lung injury (EVALI). Vitamin E acetate, likely added as a diluent 
to cannabis-containing products, was linked to EVALI. Literature searches were 
performed on vitamin E and vitamin E acetate-associated neurotoxicity. Blood 
brain barrier (BBB) penetration potential of vitamin E and vitamin E acetate 
were evaluated using cheminformatic techniques. Review of the literature showed 
that the neurotoxic potential of inhalation exposures to these compounds in 
humans is unknown. Physico-chemical properties demonstrate these compounds are 
lipophilic, and molecular weights indicate vitamin E and vitamin E acetate have 
the potential for BBB permeability. Computational models also predict both 
compounds may cross the BBB via passive diffusion. Based on literature search, 
no experimental nonclinical studies and clinical information on the neurotoxic 
potential of vitamin E via inhalation. Neurotoxic effects from pyrolysis 
by-product, phenyl acetate, structurally analogous to vitamin E acetate, 
suggests vitamin E acetate has potential for central nervous system (CNS) 
impairment. Cheminformatic model predictions provide a theoretical basis for 
potential CNS permeability of these inhaled dietary ingredients suggesting 
prioritization to evaluate for potential hazard to the CNS.

Electronic cigarettes (ECs) are battery-powered nicotine delivery devices that 
have rapidly gained popularity and attention globally. ECs work by heating a 
liquid to produce an aerosol that usually contains nicotine, flavoring 
compounds, and other chemicals, which are inhaled during vaping. EC aerosols are 
depicted to contain a lower number and overall quantity of harmful toxicants 
than conventional cigarettes (CCs). However, emerging research indicates that EC 
aerosols contain harmful ingredients including ultrafine particles, volatile 
organic compounds, and heavy metals. One common ingredient found in both CCs and 
ECs is nicotine, which has been shown to be both highly addictive and toxic. 
Particularly relevant to our current review, there is an enormous amount of 
literature that shows that smoking-derived nicotine exacerbates ischemic brain 
damage. Therefore, the question arises: will EC use impact the outcome of 
stroke? ECs are highly popular and relatively new in the market; thus, our 
understanding about the long-term effects of EC use on brain are lacking. The 
current review strives to extrapolate the existing understanding of the 
nicotine-induced effects of conventional smoking on the brain to the possible 
effects that ECs may have on the brain, which may ultimately have a potential 
for adverse stroke risk or severity.

Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) were introduced into the US market in 2007 
and have quickly become a popular source of nicotine for many patients. They are 
designed to simulate smoking by heating a nicotine-containing solution producing 
an aerosol that the user inhales. The short- and long-term effects of 
e-cigarette use are still unclear, but their use is increasing. Some acute 
effects of e-cigarettes on heart rate, blood pressure, and airway resistance are 
reported. Although there are some reports of improved cessation in a subset of 
users, there are also studies reporting decreased cessation in dual users of 
regular and e-cigarettes. Additionally, there is no current regulation of these 
devices, and this allows virtually anyone with a form of online payment to 
obtain them.

Electronic cigarette use has grown exponentially in recent years, and while 
their popularity has increased, the long-term effects on the heart are yet to be 
fully studied and understood. Originally designed as devices to assist with 
those trying to quit traditional combustible cigarette use, their popularity has 
attracted use by teens and adolescents who traditionally have not smoked 
combustible cigarettes. Acute effects on the heart have been shown to be similar 
to traditional combustible cigarettes, including increased heart rate and blood 
pressure. The main components of electronic cigarettes that contribute to these 
arrhythmic effects are found in the e-liquid that is aerosolized and inhaled, 
comprised of nicotine, flavourings, and a combination of vegetable glycerin (VG) 
and propylene glycol (PG). Nicotine can potentially induce both ventricular and 
atrial arrhythmogenesis, with both the atrial and ventricular effects resulting 
from the interactions of nicotine and the catecholamines they release via 
potassium channels. Atrial arrhythmogenesis, more specifically atrial 
fibrillation, can also occur due to structural alterations, which happens 
because of nicotine downregulating microRNAs 133 and 590, both 
post-transcriptional growth factor repressors. Liquid flavourings and the 
combination of PG and VG can possibly lead to arrhythmic events by exposing 
users to acrolein, an aldehyde that stimulates TRPA1 that in turn causes a 
change towards sympathetic activation and autonomic imbalance. The design of 
these electronic delivery devices is constantly changing; therefore, it has 
proven extremely difficult to study the long-term effects on the heart caused by 
electronic cigarettes but will be important to understand given their rising 
popularity. The arrhythmic effects of electronic cigarettes appear similar to 
traditional cigarettes as well; however, a comprehensive review has not been 
compiled and is the focus of this article.

Electronic nicotine delivery systems (often known as e-cigarettes) are a novel 
tobacco product with growing popularity, particularly among younger 
demographics. The implications for public health are twofold, as these products 
may represent a novel source of tobacco-associated disease but may also provide 
a harm reduction strategy for current tobacco users. There is increasing 
recognition that e-cigarettes impact vascular function across multiple organ 
systems. Herein, we provide a comparison of evidence regarding the role of 
e-cigarettes versus combustible tobacco in vascular disease and implications for 
blood-brain barrier dysfunction and cognitive decline. Multiple non-nicotinic 
components of tobacco smoke have been identified in e-cigarette aerosol, and 
their involvement in vascular disease is discussed. In addition, nicotine and 
nicotinic signaling may modulate peripheral immune and endothelial cell 
populations in a highly context-dependent manner. Direct preclinical evidence 
for electronic nicotine delivery system-associated neurovascular impairment is 
provided, and a model is proposed in which non-nicotinic elements exert a 
proinflammatory effect that is functionally antagonized by the presence of 
nicotine.

BACKGROUND: Little is known whether electronic cigarettes (ECIG) increase 
vulnerability to future atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. We determined, 
using an ex vivo mechanistic atherogenesis assay, whether proatherogenic changes 
including monocyte transendothelial migration and monocyte-derived foam cell 
formation are increased in people who use ECIGs.
METHODS: In a cross-sectional single-center study using plasma and peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells from healthy participants who are nonsmokers or with 
exclusive use of ECIGs or tobacco cigarettes (TCIGs), autologous peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells with patient plasma and pooled peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells from healthy nonsmokers with patient plasma were utilized to 
dissect patient-specific ex vivo proatherogenic circulating factors present in 
plasma and cellular factors present in monocytes. Our main outcomes were 
monocyte transendothelial migration (% of blood monocyte cells that undergo 
transendothelial migration through a collagen gel) and monocyte-derived foam 
cell formation as determined by flow cytometry and the median fluorescence 
intensity of the lipid-staining fluorochrome BODIPY in monocytes of participants 
in the setting of an ex vivo model of atherogenesis.
RESULTS: Study participants (N=60) had median age of 24.0 years (interquartile 
range [IQR], 22.0-25.0 years), and 31 were females. Monocyte transendothelial 
migration was increased in people who exclusively used TCIGs (n=18; median 
[IQR], 2.30 [ 1.29-2.82]; P<0.001) and in people who exclusively used ECIGs 
(n=21; median [IQR], 1.42 [ 0.96-1.91]; P<0.01) compared with nonsmoking 
controls (n=21; median [IQR], 1.05 [0.66-1.24]). Monocyte-derived foam cell 
formation was increased in people who exclusively used TCIGs (median [IQR], 2.01 
[ 1.59-2.49]; P<0.001) and in people who exclusively used ECIGs (median [IQR], 
1.54 [ 1.10-1.86]; P<0.001) compared with nonsmoker controls (median [IQR], 0.97 
[0.86-1.22]). Both monocyte transendothelial migration and monocyte-derived foam 
cell formation were higher in TCIG smokers compared with ECIG users and in ECIG 
users who were former smokers versus ECIG users who were never smokers (P<0.05 
for all comparisons).
CONCLUSIONS: The finding of alterations in proatherogenic properties of blood 
monocytes and plasma in TCIG smokers compared with nonsmokers validates this 
assay as a strong ex vivo mechanistic tool with which to measure proatherogenic 
changes in people who use ECIGs. Similar yet significantly less severe 
alterations in proatherogenic properties of monocytes and plasma were detected 
in the blood from ECIG users. Future studies are necessary to determine whether 
these findings are attributable to a residual effect of prior smoking or are a 
direct effect of current ECIG use.

In addition to the market launch of heated tobacco products (HTPs) and the JUUL 
as well as the EVALI, they caused a widespread discussion on the risk reduction 
compared to a combustible cigarette. Furthermore, first data showed harmful 
effects on the cardiovascular system. We, therefore, conducted investigations 
including a control group with a nicotine-free liquid. Forty active smokers were 
studied in two different approaches during and after consuming an HTP, a 
cigarette, a JUUL, or a typical electronic cigarette with or without nicotine in 
a partly double-blinded randomised, cross-over trial. Inflammation, endothelial 
dysfunction, and blood samples (full blood count, ELISA, multiplex immunoassay) 
were analysed, and arterial stiffness was measured. In addition to the 
cigarette, an increase in the white blood cell count but also in proinflammatory 
cytokines was shown for the various nicotine delivery systems. These correlated 
with the parameters of arterial vascular stiffness as a clinical parameter of 
endothelial dysfunction. It can be shown that even a single consumption of the 
different nicotine delivery system or cigarette leads to a significant 
inflammatory reaction followed by endothelial dysfunction and increased arterial 
stiffness causing cardiovascular disease. Inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, 
and arterial stiffness should be addressed in long-term observational studies.

Electronic cigarettes are frequently viewed as a safer alternative to 
conventional cigarettes; however, evidence to support this perspective has not 
materialized. Indeed, the current literature reports that electronic cigarette 
use is associated with both acute lung injury and subclinical dysfunction to the 
lung and vasculature that may result in pathology following chronic use. 
E-cigarettes can alter vascular dynamics, polarize innate immune populations 
towards a proinflammatory state, compromise barrier function in the pulmonary 
endothelium and epithelium, and promote pre-oncogenic phenomena. This review 
will summarize the variety of e-cigarette products available to users, discuss 
current challenges in e-cigarette study design, outline the range of pathologies 
occurring in cases of e-cigarette associated acute lung injury, highlight 
disease supporting tissue- and cellular-level changes resulting from e-cigarette 
exposure, and briefly examine how these changes may promote tumorigenesis. 
Continued research of the mechanisms by which e-cigarettes induce pathology 
benefit users and clinicians by resulting in increased regulation of vaping 
devices, informing treatments for emerging diseases e-cigarettes produce, and 
increasing public awareness to reduce e-cigarette use and the onset of 
preventable disease.

BACKGROUND: The ability of an electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) to deliver 
nicotine effectively may be dependent on features of the device, the liquid and 
the user. Some of these features have been examined in previous work (eg, liquid 
nicotine concentration and puff topography), while others have not (eg, nicotine 
dependence and demographic characteristics). The purpose of this secondary 
analysis is to examine such features as predictors of e-cigarette nicotine 
delivery using a relatively large sample.
METHODS: Four studies were combined in which e-cigarette-experienced users 
(n=63; 89% men; 75% white) and e-cigarette-naïve cigarette smokers (n=67; 66% 
men; 54% white) took 10 puffs from an eGo-style e-cigarette (~7.3 watts) filled 
with liquid that had a nicotine concentration of 18, 25 or 36 mg/mL. Thus, held 
constant across all studies were device features of battery/cartomiser style and 
power level and the topography parameters of puff number and interpuff interval. 
Blood was sampled before and after use, and puff topography was measured. Three 
general linear models were conducted to predict plasma nicotine concentrations 
(pre-post increase) for: (1) e-cigarette users only, (2) smokers only and (3) 
both groups combined. Predictor variables included puff duration, puff volume, 
liquid nicotine concentration, presession plasma nicotine concentration, 
nicotine dependence score (smokers only), gender and race.
RESULTS: In all models tested, longer puff durations and higher liquid nicotine 
concentrations were associated significantly with increased nicotine delivery 
(ps<0.05). For e-cigarette users only, higher presession nicotine concentration 
was associated significantly with increased nicotine delivery (p<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Puff duration and liquid nicotine concentration may be among the 
more important factors to consider as regulators attempt to balance e-cigarette 
safety with efficacy. These findings should be interpreted in the context of 
devices with relatively low power output, a variable not studied here but likely 
also directly relevant to product regulation.

PURPOSE: Vaping, or the use of electronic cigarettes, was initially introduced 
as a step toward smoking cessation, but has become an increasingly popular 
option for smokers. Though advertised as safer than conventional cigarettes, 
these devices have been found to contain carcinogenic chemicals, air pollutants, 
and heavy metals. The purpose of this article is to shed light on the known 
effects of vaping on the ocular setting and raise the discussion about 
additional potential effects that may call for further investigation.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted for publications 
pertaining to the effects of vaping on the eye. Relevant studies and findings 
were summarized in this article.
RESULTS: It was found that aldehydes and free radicals present in electronic 
cigarettes may induce a disturbance in tear film stability, and vape flavorings 
may damage the lipid layer through peroxidation. Corneal staining has been shown 
to appear following exposure to e-cigarette vapor, with nicotine and acrolein 
potentially inducing an inflammatory response in corneal epithelial cells. In 
addition, nicotine has been shown to induce nystagmus, exert vasoconstrictive 
effects on ocular blood flow, and may interfere with retinal light-adapted 
vision. Vape-related explosions, though unpredictable, may also result in 
decreased visual acuity along with long-term ocular trauma.
CONCLUSION: Research discussing both the short-term and long-term effects of 
vaping on the eye is limited. However, the potential harms of substances such as 
nicotine and aldehydes warrant additional investigation and increased education 
about the detriment that electronic cigarettes may inflict on sensitive organs.

The use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) has increased due to the belief 
that they are healthier than tobacco cigarettes. E-cigarettes contain a metallic 
heating coil (composed of Ni, Cr, Al and other metals) to heat a solution 
(commonly called e-liquid) and convert it into an aerosol. This aerosol is 
inhaled (vaped) by the users who can be potentially exposed to a wide variety of 
metals. We investigated the possible transfer of metals from the coil to the 
e-liquid and the generated aerosol, and how the exposure to this aerosol can 
increase metal body burden in e-cigarette users. We recruited 75 e-cigarette 
users (50 who only vaped and 25 dual users who vaped and smoked) and 25 controls 
who neither vaped nor smoked. E-liquid samples before (dispenser e-liquid) and 
after (tank e-liquid) being added to their devices were collected. Aerosol 
samples were collected using a condensation method. All participants provided 
urine and hair samples. All samples were analyzed for metals by ICP-MS. We 
observed higher metal concentrations in the aerosol and tank e-liquid (in 
contact with the coil) compared to the dispenser e-liquid (before contact with 
the coil). The median concentrations for some of the metals with the most 
remarkable increases in aerosol and tank e-liquid vs. dispenser e-liquid were 
36.90 and 62.73 vs. 18.29 μg/kg for Al; 6.71 and 28.97 vs. 0.98 μg/kg for Cr; 
91.39 and 414.47 vs. 1.64 μg/kg for Ni; 738.99 and 744.24 vs. 16.56 μg/kg for 
Zn; and 10.17 and 22.31 vs. 0.88 μg/kg for Pb. We also found detectable and 
potentially high concentrations of other metals such as Mn, Cu, Sb and Sn. In 
urine, increases in the median levels (μg/g creatinine) in vapers/duals vs. 
controls were observed for some metals, including Cr (0.34/0.28 vs. 0.20), Cu 
(1.72/2.36 vs. 1.46), Sn (0.26/0.31 vs. 0.18) and Pb (0.39/0.44 vs. 0.22). In 
hair, there were no differences in metal concentrations among the three groups. 
In conclusion, e-cigarettes are likely a source of metals such as Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb 
or Sn. These metals come from the device, likely the heating resistance, as 
their concentrations were low in the dispenser e-liquid and higher in the 
aerosol and the e-liquid left in the tank. Although the exposure to e-cigarette 
aerosol can have an influence in the body burden of metals, aerosol metal levels 
were not clearly associated with metal levels in biological samples such as 
urine or hair in e-cigarette users in this study.

Increasing evidence demonstrated the oral microbial community profile 
characteristics affected by conventional cigarettes smoking, but few studies 
focus on oral microbiome in response to electronic cigarettes (E-cigarettes). 
This study aimed to investigate the effect of E-cigarettes on the oral 
microbiome and to describe the difference of oral community profiles between 
E-cigarette smokers and tobacco smokers. 16S rRNA V4 gene sequencing was 
performed to investigate the oral microbial profiles of 5 E-cigarette smokers, 
14 tobacco smokers, 8 quitting tobacco smokers, and 6 nonsmokers. The Chao1, 
ACE, and Shannon diversity indexes increased significantly in saliva samples 
collected from E-cigarette smokers and tobacco smokers compared to the 
non-smokers, and no significant difference was found in alpha diversity between 
E-cigarette smokers and tobacco smokers. The main phyla Proteobacteria, 
Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Fusobacteria and major genera Neisseria, 
Streptococcus, Prevotellaceae, Fusobacterium, and Porphyromonas dominated in the 
smoking groups, while Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, 
and Fusobacteria became the dominant phyla along with the genera 
Corynebacterium, Neisseria, Streptococcus, Actinomyces, and Porphyromonas in the 
nonsmokers. The differences in the phylum Actinobacteria and genus 
Corynebacterium contributed to various functional differences between smokers 
and nonsmokers. The difference on oral microbial and composition between 
E-cigarettes and common tobacco were associated with increased Prevotellaceae 
and decreased Neisseria. Additionally, smoking cessation could lead to 
re-establishment of the oral microbiome to that of nonsmokers. Our data 
demonstrate that E-cigarette smoking had different effects on the structure and 
composition of the oral microbial community compared to tobacco smoking. 
However, the short- and long-term impact of E-cigarette smoking on microbiome 
composition and function needs further exploration.

BACKGROUND: Electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use continues to rise despite 
concerns of long-term effects, especially the risk of developing lung diseases 
such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Neutrophils are central to the 
pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, with changes in phenotype 
and function implicated in tissue damage.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to measure the impact of direct exposure to 
nicotine-containing and nicotine-free e-cigarette vapor on human neutrophil 
function and phenotype.
METHODS: Neutrophils were isolated from the whole blood of self-reported 
nonsmoking, nonvaping healthy volunteers. Neutrophils were exposed to 40 puffs 
of e-cigarette vapor generated from e-cigarette devices using flavorless 
e-cigarette liquids with and without nicotine before functions, deformability, 
and phenotype were assessed.
RESULTS: Neutrophil surface marker expression was altered, with CD62L and CXCR2 
expression significantly reduced in neutrophils treated with e-cigarette vapor 
containing nicotine. Neutrophil migration to IL-8, phagocytosis of Escherichia 
coli and Staphylococcus aureus pHrodo bioparticles, oxidative burst response, 
and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-stimulated neutrophil extracellular trap 
formation were all significantly reduced by e-cigarette vapor treatments, 
independent of nicotine content. E-cigarette vapor induced increased levels of 
baseline polymerized filamentous actin levels in the cytoplasm, compared with 
untreated controls.
CONCLUSIONS: The significant reduction in effector neutrophil functions after 
exposure to high-power e-cigarette devices, even in the absence of nicotine, is 
associated with excessive filamentous actin polymerization. This highlights the 
potentially damaging impact of vaping on respiratory health and reinforces the 
urgency of research to uncover the long-term health implications of 
e-cigarettes.

BACKGROUND: Cigarette smoking continues to be a major health concern and remains 
the leading preventable cause of death in the US. Recent efforts have been made 
to determine the potential health and policy benefits of reducing nicotine in 
combustible cigarettes. The degree to which changes in blood nicotine relate to 
measures of the abuse liability of reduced-nicotine cigarettes is unknown. The 
current study examined the relation between blood nicotine and behavioral 
economic demand measures of cigarettes differing in nicotine content.
METHODS: Using a within-subject design, participants smoked a single cigarette 
during each experimental session. Cigarettes included the participant's 
usual-brand cigarette and SPECTRUM investigational cigarette differing in 
nicotine level (mg of nicotine to g of tobacco; 15.8 mg/g, 5.2 mg/g, 2.4 mg/g, 
1.3 mg/g, and 0.4 mg/g). During each session, blood was collected at multiple 
timepoints and behavioral economic demand was assessed. Nonlinear mixed-effects 
models were used to estimate differences in derived intensity (Q0) and change in 
elasticity (α).
RESULTS: Measures of blood nicotine decreased in an orderly fashion related to 
nicotine level and significantly predicted change in elasticity (α), but not 
derived intensity. No differences in demand parameters between the usual brand 
and 15.8mg/g cigarettes were observed. However, α was significantly higher 
(lower valuation) for 0.4mg/g than 15.8mg/g cigarettes.
CONCLUSIONS: The lowest nicotine level (0.4mg/g) corresponded with the lowest 
abuse liability (α) compared to the full-strength control (15.8mg/g), with the 
1.3mg/g level also resulting in low abuse liability.
IMPLICATIONS: This is the first study examining the relative contributions of 
nicotine content in cigarettes and blood nicotine levels on the behavioral 
economic demand abuse liability of cigarettes ranging in nicotine content. Our 
results suggest blood nicotine and nicotine content both predict behavioral 
economic demand abuse liability. In addition, our results suggest a nicotine 
content of 1.3mg/g or lower may be effective at reducing cigarette uptake among 
first-time (naïve) smokers. Our results largely conform to previous findings 
suggesting a very low nicotine content cigarette maintains lower abuse liability 
than full-strength cigarettes.

Decades of alcohol research have established the health risks and 
pharmacodynamic profile of oral alcohol consumption. Despite isolated periods of 
public health concern, comparatively less research has evaluated exposure to 
alcohol vapor. Inhaled alcohol initially bypasses first-pass metabolism and 
rapidly reaches the arterial circulation and the brain, suggesting that this 
route of administration may be associated with pharmacological effects that 
increase the risk of addiction. However, detailed reviews assessing the possible 
effects of inhaled alcohol in humans are lacking. A comprehensive, systematic 
literature review was conducted using Google Scholar and PubMed to examine 
manuscripts studying exposure to inhaled alcohol and measurement of biomarkers 
(biochemical or functional) associated with alcohol consumption in human 
participants. Twenty-one publications reported on alcohol inhalation. Fourteen 
studies examined inhalation of alcohol vapor associated with occupational 
exposure (e.g., hand sanitizer) in a variety of settings (e.g., naturalistic, 
laboratory). Six publications measured inhalation of alcohol in a controlled 
laboratory chamber, and 1 evaluated direct inhalation of an e-cigarette with 
ethanol-containing "e-liquid." Some studies have reported that inhalation of 
alcohol vapor results in measurable biomarkers of acute alcohol exposure, most 
notably ethyl glucuronide. Despite the lack of significantly elevated blood 
alcohol concentrations, the behavioral consequences and subjective effects 
associated with repeated use of devices capable of delivering alcohol vapor are 
yet to be determined. No studies have focused on vulnerable populations, such as 
adolescents or individuals with alcohol use disorder, who may be most at risk of 
problems associated with alcohol inhalation.

Many different nicotine delivery products, such as e-cigarettes (e-cigs) or 
heated tobacco products (HTPs), are available on the market. To better 
understand these products, it is crucial to learn how consumers use them and how 
much nicotine they deliver. Therefore, a pod e-cig, an HTP, and a conventional 
cigarette (CC) were each used by 15 experienced users of the respective product 
category for 90 min without special use instructions ("ad libitum"). Sessions 
were video recorded to analyze usage patterns and puff topography. At defined 
time points, blood was sampled to determine nicotine concentrations, and 
subjective effects were inquired about using questionnaires. During the study 
period, the CC and HTP groups averaged the same number of consumption units 
(both 4.2 units). In the pod e-cig group, the highest number of puffs was taken 
(pod e-cig 71.9; HTP: 52.2; CC: 42.3 puffs) with the most extended mean puff 
duration (pod e-cig: 2.8 s; HTP: 1.9 s; CC: 1.8 s). Pod e-cigs were 
predominantly used with single puffs or in short clusters of 2-5 puffs. The 
maximum plasma nicotine concentration was highest for CCs, followed by HTPs, and 
then pod e-cigs with 24.0, 17.7, and 8.0 ng/mL, respectively. Craving was 
reduced by all products. The results suggest that the high nicotine delivery 
known for tobacco-containing products (CCs and HTPs) may not be needed for 
non-tobacco-containing products (pod e-cigs) to satisfy cravings in experienced 
users.

(1)Gene Engineering Drug and Biotechnology Beijing Key Laboratory, Beijing 
Normal University, Beijing, China.

BACKGROUND: We were curious if the urinary proteome could reflect the effects of 
e-cigarettes on the organism.
METHODS: Urine samples were collected from a rat e-cigarette model before, 
during, and after two weeks of e-cigarette smoking. Urine proteomes before and 
after smoking of each rat were compared individually, while the control group 
was set up to rule out differences caused by rat growth and development.
RESULTS: Fetuin-B, a biomarker of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 
and annexin A2, which is recognized as a multiple tumour marker, were identified 
as differential proteins in five out of six smoking rats on day 3. To our 
surprise, odourant-binding proteins expressed in the olfactory epithelium were 
also found and were significantly upregulated. Pathways enriched by the 
differential proteins include the apelin signalling pathway, folate biosynthesis 
pathway, arachidonic acid metabolism, chemical carcinogenesis-DNA adducts and 
chemical carcinogenesis-reactive oxygen species. They have been reported to be 
associated with immune system, cardiovascular system, respiratory system, etc.
CONCLUSIONS: Urinary proteome could reflect the effects of e-cigarettes in rats.

The NHLBI convened a working group on October 23, 2019, to identify the most 
relevant and urgent research priorities and prevailing challenges in e-cigarette 
or vaping product use-associated lung injury (EVALI). Experts across multiple 
disciplines discussed the complexities of the EVALI outbreak, identified 
research priorities, and recommended strategies to address most effectively its 
causal factors and improve diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of this disease. 
Many research priorities were identified, including the need to create national 
and international registries of patients with EVALI, to track accurately those 
affected and assess outcomes. The group concluded that biospecimens from 
subjects with EVALI are urgently needed to help define EVALI pathogenesis and 
that vaping has disease risks that are disparate from smoking, with the 
occurrence of EVALI highlighting the importance of broadening e-cigarette 
research beyond comparators to smoking-related diseases.

OBJECTIVE: Found in plasma, urine, and saliva, cotinine can be used as a 
biomarker for nicotine in electronic cigarette (e-cig) users. Nicotine is 
addictive and causes dependence. Thus, it becomes a problem in smoking cessation 
programs. This study aimed to determine the relationship between urinary 
cotinine (UCot) and nicotine dependence levels in regular male e-cig users.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study consecutively included regular 
male e-cig users and nonsmokers. All subjects were interviewed and had their 
UCot levels measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. The 
regular e-cig users completed the Penn State Nicotine Dependence Index 
questionnaire.
RESULTS: This study recruited 71 males aged 18-45 years divided into e-cig users 
and non-smokers group. The predominating characteristics in e-cig users are as 
follows: 23 males (67.6%) aged <30 years, the highest education of senior high 
school 25 (73.5%) and 25 (73.5%) subjects had occupation. The UCot levels among 
the e-cig users in the non-dependency group were lower than that of the 
medium-high dependency group (P = .008). The median value for UCot level in the 
regular e-cig users was higher than that of the non-smoker group (276.11 
[58.01-284.15] ng/mL vs 5.21 [4.65-23.72] ng/mL, P < .001). Factors influencing 
the UCot levels of the e-cig users were age (P = .041), nicotine level of the 
e-cig liquid (P = .013), and the flavor of the e-cig liquid (eg, menthol or 
non-menthol; P = .040).
CONCLUSION: UCot and nicotine dependence levels in the regular male e-cig users 
were significantly related. Nicotine dependence was found in 76.5% of the 
regular male e-cig users. The UCot levels in the e-cig users were significantly 
higher than in the non-smokers.

PURPOSE: To determine the association between cigarette use (i.e., never-use - 
reference group, exclusive e-cigarette users, exclusive cigarette smoking, and 
dual use of both products) with cardiometabolic risk biomarkers.
METHODS: Data came from two cycles (2015-2016 and 2017-2018) of the National 
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We used weighted logistic regression 
models to determine the association of cigarette use and reduced high-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C; <40 mg/dL, for men and <50 mg/dL for women), 
elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C; ≥130 mg/dL), elevated 
triglycerides (TG; ≥150 mg/dL), elevated fasting blood glucose (FBG; 
(≥100 mg/dL), and high blood pressure (HBP; Systolic ≥130 mm Hg/Diastolic ≥85 mm 
Hg).
RESULTS: Of the 8688 adults 18+ years of age included, 2.7%, 3.2%, and 14.9% 
self-reported exclusive e-cigarette, dual use, and exclusive cigarette smoking 
respectively. After adjusting for covariates, exclusive e-cigarette use was 
significantly associated with increased odds of HBP (adjusted odds ratio 
[aOR] = 2.05, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.03, 4.08). Dual use was 
associated with increased odds of reduced HDL-C (aOR = 1.64, 95% [CI] = 1.01, 
2.70). Exclusive cigarette smoking was significantly associated with reduced 
HDL-C (aOR=1.80, 95% [CI]=1.45, 2.23) and elevated TG (aOR = 1.59, 95% [CI] = 
1.01, 2.52).
CONCLUSIONS: Results are preliminary and warrant replication from larger samples 
with longitudinal follow-up.

BACKGROUND: Women who use combined hormonal contraceptives and cigarettes have 
an increased risk for cardiovascular (CV) events. We reviewed the literature to 
determine whether women who use hormonal contraceptives (HC) and electronic 
cigarettes (e-cigarettes) also have an increased risk.
STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review.
METHODS: We searched for articles reporting myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, 
venous thromboembolism, peripheral arterial disease or changes to CV markers in 
women using e-cigarettes and HC. We also searched for indirect evidence, such as 
CV outcomes among e-cigarette users in the general population and among HC users 
exposed to nicotine, propylene glycol or glycerol.
RESULTS: No articles reported on outcomes among e-cigarette users using HC. 
Among the general population, 13 articles reported on heart rate or blood 
pressure after e-cigarette use. These markers generally remained normal, even 
when significant changes were observed. In three studies, changes were less 
pronounced after e-cigarette use than cigarette use. One MI was reported among 
1012 people exposed to e-cigarettes in these studies. One article on nicotine 
and HC exposure found both exposures to be significantly associated with acute 
changes to heart rate, though mean heart rate remained normal. No articles on 
propylene glycol or glycerol and HC exposure were identified.
CONCLUSION: We identified no evidence on CV outcomes among e-cigarette users 
using HC. Limited data reporting mostly acute outcomes suggested that CV events 
are rare among e-cigarette users in the general population and that e-cigarettes 
may affect heart rate and blood pressure less than conventional cigarettes. 
There is a need for research assessing joint HC and e-cigarette exposure on 
clinical CV outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Vaping, the use of an electronic device to deliver a drug-infused 
aerosol has become an increasingly popular way to consume nicotine since its 
introduction to the market in the early 2000s. Despite the differences in 
consumption patterns relative to combustible tobacco, the impact of ad libitum 
nicotine vaping on cardiovascular response has not been thoroughly studied.
SUBJECT AND METHODS: This research was conducted on vapers (n = 17) and smokers 
(n = 14) who represent a subsample of a larger study that explored the 
relationship between nicotine use, activities of daily living and 24-hour 
cardiovascular response using Spacelabs ambulatory blood pressure monitors. 
These data were analysed via ANOVA models and t-tests using SPSS 25.0 for 
Macintosh.
RESULTS: Vapers consumed nicotine significantly more frequently than did 
smokers, at 48.2% and 18.1% of every 15-minute waking measurement, respectively 
(p = 0.000). The act of nicotine consumption, rather than the mode of delivery, 
was significantly associated with increases in systolic, diastolic, mean 
arterial pressure, and heart rate readings. There was no difference in the mean 
amplitude of response to nicotine between vapers and smokers.
CONCLUSIONS: This study's strong statistical findings, visually evident on 
ambulatory blood pressure monitor reports, demonstrated that ad libitum nicotine 
consumption has an acute, dose-dependent effect on cardiovascular response 
regardless of whether it is smoked or vaped. However, since vapers consumed 
nicotine more frequently, future studies should be conducted with larger sample 
sizes, and controlled for age and comorbidities to improve statistical strength.
IMPLICATIONS: This pilot study reveals that, when ad lib consumption is 
documented and measured, vaping has unique and potentially harmful effects on 
blood pressure, pulse, and mean arterial pressure. Because nicotine is consumed 
for much longer stretches, vapers have fewer rest periods between nicotine 
doses.

AIM: To report on the clinical, laboratory, and radiological findings of 
adolescents who presented during the SARS-CoV-2 surge with symptoms of 
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), did not test positive for the infection, 
and were diagnosed with E-cigarette and vaping product use associated lung 
injury (EVALI).
METHODS: A retrospective review of 12 cases of EVALI admitted to the Bristol 
Meyers Squibb Children's Hospital between February 2020 and June 2020 was 
conducted.
RESULTS: The ages of the patients ranged from 14 to 19 years. There were 
six males and six females. Three patients had a past history of anxiety, 
depression, or other psychiatric/mental health disorder, 9 had prolonged 
coagulation profile (prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and/or 
International Normalized Ratio), and 11 had elevated inflammatory markers. Eight 
needed respiratory support. All 12 were negative for SARS-CoV-2 PCR. Four were 
tested for IgG antibodies and were negative. As these cases were admitted to 
rule out COVID infection, initial treatment included hydroxychloroquine. 
Steroids were started only after SARS-CoV-2 PCR was shown to be negative. Urine 
tetrahydrocannabinol was positive in all cases. Chest X-ray and computed 
tomography findings showed ground glass opacities.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinical and radiological features are similar in both EVALI and 
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Inflammatory markers are elevated in both conditions. A 
detailed social and substance use history in patients presenting with "typical" 
COVID pneumonia like illness is important. EVALI should be ruled in early to 
start the appropriate treatment. Given the ongoing pandemic, pediatricians and 
other health-care providers need to be aware of other conditions that can 
masquerade as SARS-CoV-2.

A 23-year-old man arrives at the ED with a 3-week history of dyspnea, dry cough, 
fevers, and night sweats. Two weeks previously, he was evaluated in an 
outpatient clinic and given a course of azithromycin for presumed infectious 
pneumonia. His symptoms did not improve, and he was seen 1 week later in an 
urgent care center and given a prescription for doxycycline, which he has been 
taking without improvement. He states that he feels miserable, has severe nausea 
and vomiting, and has not eaten in several days. His only medical history is 
childhood asthma. He reports no surgeries and takes no medications. He has no 
risk factors for HIV, does not smoke combustible cigarettes or use IV drugs, and 
has not recently traveled. Examination shows a room air saturation of 89%, a 
temperature of 38.3°C, and a respiratory rate of 22 breaths/min. Results of his 
examination are normal, and there are no rales or wheezing heard in the lungs. 
Chest radiograph shows bilateral, consolidative opacities. WBC count is 14,000, 
with left shift. Results of biochemistries are normal. Erythrocyte sedimentation 
rate is 104, and procalcitonin is 0.08. Urine toxicology screen is positive for 
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Asked specifically about vaping and e-cigarette use, 
he reports that he recently began using THC "carts" that his friend gets from an 
unknown supplier. What is the diagnosis and what additional steps are necessary 
to confirm it? Is bronchoscopy indicated?

BACKGROUND: We examined the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) enzyme levels in the 
saliva of vapers (e-cigarette users) and compared the data with cigarette 
smokers and a control group of non-smokers and non-vapers.
METHODS: Subjects were recruited among those responding to a social media 
announcement or patients attending the SEGi Oral Health Care Centre between May 
and December 2019, and among some staff at the centre. Five ml of unstimulated   
whole saliva was collected and salivary LDH enzyme activity levels were measured 
with a LDH colorimetric assay kit. Salivary LDH activity level was determined 
for each group and compared statistically.
RESULTS: Eighty-eight subjects were categorized into three groups (control n=30, 
smokers n=29, and vapers n=29). The mean ± standard deviation (SD) values for 
salivary LDH activity levels for vapers, smokers, and control groups were 35.15 
± 24.34 mU/ml, 30.82 ± 20.73 mU/ml, and 21.45 ± 15.30 mU/ml, respectively. The 
salivary LDH activity levels of smoker and vaper groups were significantly 
higher than in the control group (p = 0.031; 0.017). There was no significant 
difference of salivary LDH activity level in vapers when compared with smokers 
(p= 0.234).
CONCLUSION: Our findings showed higher LDH levels in the saliva of vapers when 
compared with controls, confirming cytotoxic and harmful effects of e-cigarettes 
on the oral mucosa.

OBJECTIVES: E-cigarettes could potentially play a major role in tobacco harm 
reduction by delivering nicotine in a vapor containing significantly fewer 
toxicants than cigarette smoke and may aid smoking behavior changes such as 
reduction or cessation.
METHODS: We examined blood nicotine levels in smokers who were non-accustomed to 
e-cigarette use (Study 1) and accustomed e-cigarette users (Study 2). We 
compared nicotine levels when participants used a closed modular system 
e-cigarette to those when participants smoked a cigarette.
RESULTS: In Study 1, Cmax (geometric mean (CV)) during a 5-minute puffing period 
(10 puffs, 30 seconds apart) was 13.4 (51.4) ng/ ml for a regular cigarette. The 
e-cigarette Cmax was significantly lower (p .05) at 2.5 (67.8) ng/ml. In Study 
2, during a 5-minute ad libitum puffing period, cigarette Cmax was 7.2 (130.8) 
ng/mL, and it was 7.8 (108.2) ng/mL for the e-cigarette.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate heterogeneity of nicotine deliveries both 
between products and also with the same products used by different cohorts, eg, 
accustomed users versus smokers. Such differences must be taken into account 
when determining the likely behavioral impact, on smoking reduction and 
cessation, of nicotine delivery data and when planning e-cigarette nicotine 
pharmacokinetic studies.

PURPOSE: Electronic cigarettes (ECs) are the fastest growing tobacco product in 
the USA, and ECs, like tobacco cigarettes (TCs), have effects on the 
cardiovascular autonomic nervous system, with clinical implications. The purpose 
of this review was to collect and synthesize available studies that have 
investigated the autonomic cardiovascular effects of EC use in humans. Special 
attention is paid to the acute and chronic effects of ECs, the relative 
contributions of the nicotine versus non-nicotine constituents in EC emissions 
and the relative effects of ECs compared to TCs.
METHODS: Using the methodology described in the Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement, we conducted a 
literature search of the Ovid PubMed and Embase databases on 6 December 2019 
using keywords in titles and abstracts of published literature. Acute (minutes 
to hours) and chronic (days or longer) changes in heart rate variability (HRV), 
heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) were used as estimates of cardiovascular 
autonomic effects.
RESULTS: Nineteen studies were included in this systematic review, all of which 
used earlier generation EC devices. Acute EC vaping increased HR and BP less 
than acute TC smoking. Nicotine but not non-nicotine constituents in EC aerosol 
were responsible for the sympathoexcitatory effects. The results of chronic EC 
vaping studies were consistent with a chronic sympathoexcitatory effect as 
estimated by HRV, but this did not translate into chronic increases in HR or BP.
CONCLUSIONS: Electronic cigarettes are sympathoexcitatory. Cardiac 
sympathoexcitatory effects are less when vaping using the earlier generation ECs 
than when smoking TCs. Additional studies of the latest pod-like EC devices, 
which deliver nicotine similarly to a TC, are necessary.

Despite the growing use of electronic cigarettes (EC) in the Unites States, 
particularly among young people, and their perceived safety, current evidence 
suggests that EC usage may cause adverse clinical cardiovascular effects. 
Therefore, we aim to pool all studies evaluating the association of EC exposure 
with cardiovascular health. Medline, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Scopus were searched 
for studies from January 1, 2006 until December 31, 2022. Randomized and 
observational studies reporting cardiovascular outcomes, hemodynamic parameters, 
and biomarkers of platelet physiology, before and after acute or chronic EC 
exposure were pooled using a random-effects model. Overall, 27 studies (n = 863) 
were included. Heart rate increased significantly after acute EC exposure 
(weighted mean difference [WMD]: 0.76 bpm; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.48, 
1.03; P < 0.00001; I2 = 92%). Significant increases in systolic blood pressure 
(WMD: 0.28 mmHg; 95% CI, 0.06, 0.51; P = 0.01; I2 = 94%), diastolic blood 
pressure (WMD: 0.38 mmHg; 95% CI, 0.16, 0.60; P = 0.0006; I2 = 90%), and PWV 
(WMD: 0.38; 95% CI, 0.13, 0.63; P = 0.003; I2 = 100%) were also observed. 
Augmentation index increased significantly (SMD: 0.39; 95% CI, 0.11, 0.67; 
P = 0.007; I2 = 90%), whereas reduction in flow-mediated dilation (WMD: -1.48; 
95% CI, -2.49, -0.47; P = 0.004; I2 = 45%) was observed. Moreover, significant 
rise in both soluble P-selectin (WMD: 4.73; 95% CI, 0.80, 8.66; P = 0.02; 
I2 = 98%) and CD40L (WMD: 1.14; 95% CI, 0.41, 1.87; P = 0.002; I2 = 79%) was 
observed. Our results demonstrate that smoking EC is associated with a 
significant increase in cardiovascular hemodynamic measures and biomarkers. Our 
findings can aid policymakers in making informed decisions regarding the 
regulation of EC to ensure public safety.

BACKGROUND: E-cigarette use is rapidly growing, and little is known about the 
postoperative complications. Cigarette smoking has been well-established to be 
associated with delayed wound healing and increased complications in surgical 
patients. Due to the intricate and harmonious nature of the wound-healing 
process, vaping may impair tissue regeneration, posing a risk for patients 
undergoing surgery. This systematic review aimed to review the evidence on the 
implications of vaping on wound healing.
METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed and Scopus databases was conducted on 
October 2022 per Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses guidelines. The following keywords were used to conduct the 
search: vaping, vape, e-cigarettes, electronic cigarettes, wound healing, tissue 
regeneration, postoperative complications, wound infection, and blood flow.
RESULTS: Of 5,265 screened articles, only 37 were eligible for qualitative 
synthesis. A total of 18 articles studied the effect of e-cigarettes on human 
volunteers, 14 investigated e-cigarette extract on human cell lines, and 5 used 
animal rat models.
CONCLUSION: Despite limited objective data, the recommendation is that 
e-cigarettes be treated as tobacco cigarettes; hence, vaping should be stopped 
in the perioperative period to decrease the incidence of wound healing 
complications. Clinical trials are required to understand the health hazards of 
e-cigarettes further and maximize patient safety and clinical outcomes.

Despite the increasing popularity of e-cigarettes, their long-term health 
effects remain unknown. In animal models, exposure to e-cigarette has been 
reported to result in pulmonary and cardiovascular injury, and in humans, the 
acute use of e-cigarettes increases heart rate and blood pressure and induces 
endothelial dysfunction. In both animal models and humans, cardiovascular 
dysfunction associated with e-cigarettes has been linked to reactive aldehydes 
such as formaldehyde and acrolein generated in e-cigarette aerosols. These 
aldehydes are known products of heating and degradation of vegetable glycerin 
(VG) present in e-liquids. Here, we report that in mice, acute exposure to a 
mixture of propylene glycol:vegetable glycerin (PG:VG) or to e-cigarette-derived 
aerosols significantly increased the urinary excretion of acrolein and glycidol 
metabolites─3-hydroxypropylmercapturic acid (3HPMA) and 
2,3-dihydroxypropylmercapturic acid (23HPMA)─as measured by UPLC-MS/MS. In 
humans, the use of e-cigarettes led to an increase in the urinary levels of 
23HPMA but not 3HPMA. Acute exposure of mice to aerosols derived from PG:13C3-VG 
significantly increased the 13C3 enrichment of both urinary metabolites 
13C3-3HPMA and 13C3-23HPMA. Our stable isotope tracing experiments provide 
further evidence that thermal decomposition of vegetable glycerin in the 
e-cigarette solvent leads to generation of acrolein and glycidol. This suggests 
that the adverse health effects of e-cigarettes may be attributable in part to 
these reactive compounds formed through the process of aerosolizing nicotine. 
Our findings also support the notion that 23HPMA, but not 3HPMA, may be a 
relatively specific biomarker of e-cigarette use.

The present study investigated whether electronic cigarette use, which is 
becoming increasingly common, was related to systemic inflammation that may lead 
to cardiovascular disease, similar to conventional cigarette smoking. The study 
included 1208 men (19-65 years old) who participated in the 7th Korean National 
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2016). The participants were 
categorized as electronic cigarette users, conventional cigarette users, and 
nonsmokers. Serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein was used as an 
inflammatory index, and uric acid level was used as a metabolic indicator. After 
adjusting for confounding factors, electronic cigarette use was significantly 
associated with elevated serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels (β = 
1.326, P = .002), uric acid levels (β = 0.400, P = .042), and hyperuricemia 
(uric acid level of >7 mg/mL; odds ratio = 2.67, 95% confidence interval = 
1.27-5.58). These findings suggest that electronic cigarette use may be 
associated with systemic inflammation markers, similar to conventional cigarette 
use.

Nicotine Vapor Method to Induce Nicotine Dependence in Rodents.

Kallupi M(1), George O(1).

Author information:

California.

Nicotine, the main addictive component of tobacco, induces potentiation of brain 
stimulation reward, increases locomotor activity, and induces conditioned place 
preference. Nicotine cessation produces a withdrawal syndrome that can be 
relieved by nicotine replacement therapy. In the last decade, the market for 
electronic cigarettes has flourished, especially among adolescents. The nicotine 
vaporizer or electronic nicotine delivery system is a battery-operated device 
that allows the user to simulate the experience of tobacco smoking without 
inhaling smoke. The device is designed to be an alternative to conventional 
cigarettes that emits vaporized nicotine inhaled by the user. This report 
describes a procedure to vaporize nicotine in the air to produce blood nicotine 
levels in rodents that are clinically relevant to those that are observed in 
humans and produce dependence. We also describe how to construct the apparatus 
to deliver nicotine vapor in a stable, reliable, and consistent manner, as well 
as how to analyze air for nicotine content. © 2017 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

OBJECTIVES: Urine propylene glycol (PG) and vegetable glycerin (VG) were 
evaluated as potential markers for discriminating ECIG users from non-users and 
verifying ECIG abstinence.
METHODS: Urine samples from 51 ECIG users (collected pre/post 12-hours ECIG 
abstinence), and 50 controls (who do not use nicotine/tobacco) were analyzed for 
urine cotinine, PG, and VG concentration.
RESULTS: Of 42 ECIG users with pre-abstinence urine cotinine indicating nicotine 
use, mean (SD) urine cotinine concentration was 1053.7 ng/ml (874.5) and for 
controls was 1.93 ng/ml (0.4); after abstinence, ECIG users' mean cotinine 
decreased to 615.4 ng/ml (753.0). For ECIG users, mean urine PG pre-abstinence 
was 25.6 mcg/ml (20.0) and was 9.8 mcg/ml (13.5) for controls; after abstinence, 
ECIG users' mean urine PG decreased to 9.7 mcg/ml (15.0; ps < .05). For ECIG 
users, mean urine VG pre-abstinence was 7.5 mcg/ml (7.1) and was 13.2 mcg/ml 
(25.0) for controls; after abstinence, ECIG users' mean VG decreased to 5.0 
mcg/ml (4.4; ps < .05).
CONCLUSIONS: ECIG users' mean urine PG was greater than controls and decreased 
after 12-hours ECIG abstinence suggesting urine PG may be useful for 
discriminating ECIG users from non-users and verifying short-term abstinence.

Increasing popularity of electronic cigarettes (e-cigs), including among women 
of reproductive age, is attributed to its perceived safety compared to 
conventional tobacco. However, there is a major knowledge gap surrounding the 
effects of e-cig aerosols on pregnancy and fetal development. We aimed to 
evaluate the effects of vaping e-cigs during gestation on offspring growth and 
to asses if growth deficits are accompanied by altered maternal and fetal 
vascular hemodynamics. Sprague-Dawley dams were assigned to Pair-Fed Control, 
Pair-Fed Juice, or Juice+Nicotine groups, and then underwent either a prenatal 
or prenatal+postnatal exposure paradigm in a custom-engineered vaping system. 
Mass spectrometry identified major aerosolized constituents from e-cig vaping. 
The Juice+Nicotine group exhibited significantly decreased fetal weight and 
crown-rump length (↓46.56%, and ↓23.83%, respectively). Pre- and postnatal 
exposure to Juice+Nicotine resulted in decreased pup weight at postnatal day 
(PND) 4-10. Crown-rump length was decreased by 24.71% on PND 10. Blood flow in 
the Juice+Nicotine group was decreased in the maternal uterine and fetal 
umbilical circuits by 49.50% and 65.33%, respectively. We conclude that chronic 
exposure to e-cig aerosols containing nicotine during early development can have 
deleterious health effects on the exposed offspring. Vaping e-cigs containing 
nicotine during pregnancy lead to a reduction in offspring weight and crown-rump 
length, associated with a marked decrease in blood flow in both the maternal 
uterine and fetal umbilical circulation (a strong indicator of growth 
restriction). Thus, chronic exposure to e-cig aerosols containing nicotine can 
lead to potentially harmful developmental effects in early life.

Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Houston, Texas.

BACKGROUND: Use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) and other nicotine 
containing products is increasing among women of reproductive age. The short- 
and long-term effects of these products on both mother and fetus are unknown.
METHODS: Because e-cigarettes are nicotine delivery systems, we sought to 
conduct a comprehensive review of the effects of nicotine on the fetus.
RESULTS: In utero nicotine exposure in animal models is associated with adverse 
effects for the offspring lung, cardiovascular system and brain. In the lung, 
this included reduced surface area, weight, and volume, as well as 
emphysema-like lesions. In adulthood, exposed offspring demonstrate elevated 
blood pressure and increased perivascular adipose tissue. In the brain, exposure 
alters offspring serotonergic, dopaminergic, and norepinephrine networks, which 
in turn are associated with behavioral and cognitive impairments. We also review 
current data on the lack of efficacy of nicotine replacement therapy in pregnant 
women, and highlight different nicotine containing products such as snuff, snus, 
and hookah.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that no amount of nicotine is known to be safe during 
pregnancy, and studies specifically addressing this risk are crucial and an 
imminent public health issue.

BACKGROUND: As of March 2019, JUUL electronic cigarettes are the most popular 
e-cigarette on the U.S. market, but little is known of nicotine exposure and 
dependence on JUUL and user experience.
METHODS: JUUL users participated in a community-based study involving 
questionnaires, saliva collection and a qualitative interview.
RESULTS: Fifteen participants were enrolled (80% male, 53% White) and had an 
average age of 29.8 (standard deviation = 10) years. Daily exposure to nicotine 
assessed via salivary cotinine was similar to those reported for other 
e-cigarette and tobacco cigarette users in general. The majority reported low to 
moderate nicotine dependence. Qualitative interview themes included: the 
importance of social networks in adoption and use of the product; device 
features such as small size and vapor cloud reinforced product use; the product 
provided satisfaction compared to a tobacco cigarette; and a perceived sense of 
addiction to the product.
CONCLUSIONS: JUUL e-cigarettes expose users to levels of nicotine similar to 
other e-cigarettes but may be more satisfying due to unique device features. 
JUUL may be quite acceptable to tobacco cigarette smokers who are seeking to 
quit. However, it holds addictive potential and can reinforce long-term nicotine 
use.

BACKGROUND: The capability of electronic cigarette devices (e-cigs) to deliver 
nicotine is key to their potential to replace combustible cigarettes. We 
compared nicotine delivery and subjective effects associated with the use of two 
classes of e-cigarettes and cigarettes.
METHODS: 14 e-cigarette users were instructed to vape their own e-cigarette 
device every 20 seconds for 10 minutes while blood was drawn at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 
10,12, and 15 minutes after initiating vaping. Users rated withdrawal symptoms 
and side effects before and after vaping. E-cigarette devices were classified as 
first-generation (same size as cigarette, no activation button) or advanced 
(larger than cigarette with an activation button). Separately, 10 cigarette 
smokers completed a similar protocol. Fisher's Exact Test and two-sided t-tests 
were used as appropriate to determine differences in outcomes between 
first-generation e-cigarette users, advanced e-cigarette users, and smokers.
RESULTS: Compared to first-generation devices, advanced devices were associated 
with greater serum nicotine Cmax (ng/ml) (11.5 v. 2.8, p = 0.0231) and greater 
nicotine boost (ng/ml) (10.8 v. 1.8, p = 0.0177). Overall, e-cigarettes users 
experienced a significant reduction in withdrawal and craving, although there 
were no significant differences between users of first-generation and advanced 
devices. Comparing e-cigarettes overall to cigarettes, cigarettes were 
associated with greater Cmax (25.9 v. 9.0, p = 0.0043) and greater nicotine 
boost (21.0 v. 8.2, p = 0.0128).
CONCLUSIONS: Advanced e-cigarettes delivered significantly more nicotine than 
first-generation devices but less than combustible cigarettes. Overall, 
e-cigarette use was associated with a reduction in withdrawal and craving with 
no reported side effects. The wide variation in nicotine absorption from 
different e-cigarette devices should be considered in studies of e-cigarettes 
for smoking cessation.

Nitrosamine metabolites resulting from cigarette smoking and E-cigarette (E-cig) 
vaping cause DNA damage that can lead to genotoxicity. While DNA adducts of 
metabolites of nitrosamines 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) 
and N-nitrosonornicotine (NNN) are well-known tobacco-related cancer biomarkers, 
only a few studies implicate NNN and NNK in DNA oxidation in humans. NNK and NNN 
were found in the urine of E-cigarette users who never smoked cigarettes. This 
paper proposes the first chemical pathways of DNA oxidation driven by NNK and 
NNN metabolites in redox reactions with Cu2+ and NADPH leading to reactive 
oxygen species (ROS). A microfluidic array with thin films of DNA and metabolic 
enzymes that make metabolites of NNN and NNK in the presence of Cu2+ and NADPH 
was used to estimate relative rates of DNA oxidation. Detection by 
electrochemiluminescence (ECL) employed a new ECL dye [Os(tpy-benz-COOH)2]2+ 
that is selective for and sensitive to the primary DNA oxidation product 
8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) in DNA. Enzyme-DNA films on 
magnetic beads were used to produce nitrosamine metabolites that enter 
ROS-forming redox cycles with Cu2+ and NADPH, and liquid chromatography-mass 
spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to quantify 8-oxodG and identify metabolites. ROS 
were detected by optical sensors. Metabolites of NNK and NNN + Cu2+ + NADPH 
generated relatively high rates of DNA oxidation. Lung is the exposure route in 
smoking and vaping, human lung tissue contains Cu2+ and NADPH, and lung 
microsomal enzymes gave the highest rates of DNA oxidation in this study. Also, 
E-cigarette vapor contains 6-fold more copper than that in cigarette smoke, 
which could exacerbate DNA oxidation.

BACKGROUND: Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDSs) are used by some 
smokers to reduce cigarette consumption, but their effectiveness is uncertain. 
We aimed to examine the extent to which ENDSs or a non-nicotine cigarette 
substitute influence tobacco-related toxicant exposure and cigarette consumption 
in smokers interested in smoking reduction.
METHODS: We did a four-arm, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial at two 
sites in the USA (Penn State University, Hershey, PA, and Virginia Commonwealth 
University, Richmond, VA). We enrolled adults aged 21-65 years who smoked more 
than nine cigarettes per day (for at least the past year), with exhaled CO of 
more than 9 parts per million at screening, who were not currently using an 
ENDS, and who were interested in reducing smoking but not quitting. Participants 
were randomised (site-specific with allocation concealment; 1:1:1:1) to receive 
either a cartomiser-based, pen-style ENDS (eGo-style) paired with 0, 8, or 36 
mg/mL liquid nicotine (participants and researchers masked to concentration) or 
a non-ENDS cigarette-shaped plastic tube that delivered no nicotine or aerosol 
(cigarette substitute; unmasked) for 24 weeks. Conditions were chosen to reflect 
a range of nicotine delivery including none (cigarette substitute and 0 mg/mL 
ENDS), low (8 mg/mL), and cigarette-like (36 mg/mL), and all conditions were 
paired with smoking reduction instructions. The primary outcome was 
concentration of the tobacco-specific carcinogen metabolite 
4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL; urinary total) collected at 
randomisation and at 4, 12, and 24 weeks. Multiple imputation with and without 
covariate adjustment was used in addition to sensitivity analyses. This trial is 
registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02342795.
FINDINGS: Between July 22, 2015, and Nov 16, 2017, 684 individuals were screened 
and 520 (76%) were enrolled and randomised. 188 (36%) of 520 participants were 
lost to follow-up by week 24; attrition did not differ by study group (39 [30%] 
of 130 in the cigarette substitute group, 56 [43%] of 130 in the ENDS with 0 
mg/mL nicotine group, 49 [38%] of 130 in the ENDS 8 mg/mL group, and 44 [34%] of 
130 in the ENDS 36 mg/mL group). Urinary total NNAL at 24 weeks in the ENDS with 
36 mg/mL nicotine group was 210·80 pg/mg creatinine (95% CI 163·03-274·42) 
compared with 346·09 pg/mg creatinine (265·00-455·32) in the cigarette 
substitute group (p=0·0061). No other significant differences between groups 
were observed for any time point for urinary total NNAL. Serious adverse event 
frequency was similar across groups (12 events in 12 participants [9%] in the 
ENDS with 36 mg/mL nicotine group, seven events in six participants [5%] in the 
8 mg/mL group, 11 events in ten participants [8%] in the 0 mg/mL group, and 13 
events in 13 participants [10%] in the cigarette substitute group), and all of 
these were deemed unrelated or unlikely to be related to study product use. 
There was one death between randomisation and 24 weeks (suicide; in the ENDS 
with 0 mg/mL nicotine group).
INTERPRETATION: Use of an ENDS with cigarette-like nicotine delivery can reduce 
exposure to a major pulmonary carcinogen, NNAL, even with concurrent smoking. 
Future ENDS trials should involve products with well characterised nicotine 
delivery, including those with nicotine delivery approaching that of a 
cigarette.

INTRODUCTION: This study examined user behavior, e-cigarette dependence, and 
device characteristics on nicotine intake among users of pod-mod e-cigarettes.
AIMS AND METHODS: In 2019-2020, people who use pod-mods in the San Francisco Bay 
Area completed questionnaires and provided a urine sample for analysis of total 
nicotine equivalents (TNE). The relationship between TNE and e-cigarette use, 
e-cigarette brands, e-liquid nicotine strength, e-cigarette dependence, and 
urine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL), as a measure of 
combustible cigarette exposure, were examined.
RESULTS: Of 100 participants (64% male, 71% in the 18-34 age group, 45% white), 
53 used JUUL primarily, 12 used Puff Bar primarily, and 35 used other brands, 
including Suorin; 48 participants reported current cigarette smoking. 
Participants most often reported use of e-liquid with 4.5%-6.0% nicotine (68%), 
fruit (35%), tobacco (28%), and menthol or mint flavors (26%), used e-cigarettes 
on 25.5 (SD = 6.3) days a month, 10.2 (SD = 14.2) times a day, and 40% used 1-2 
pods/cartridges per week. In bivariate analysis, urinary TNE was higher with 
greater frequency (days used) and intensity (number of pods used) of e-cigarette 
use, e-cigarette dependence, and combustible cigarette use. In multivariable 
analysis, days of e-cigarette use in the last 30 days, number of pods used per 
week, and NNAL levels were significantly associated with TNE. There was no 
significant impact of e-liquid nicotine strength on TNE.
CONCLUSIONS: Nicotine intake among people who used pod-mod e-cigarettes 
increased with e-cigarette consumption and e-cigarette dependence, but not with 
e-liquid nicotine strength. Our findings may inform whether FDA adopts a 
nicotine standard for e-cigarettes.
IMPLICATIONS: The study examined how device and user characteristics influence 
nicotine intake among pod-mod e-cigarette users. Nicotine intake increased with 
frequency (days of e-cigarette use in past 30 days) intensity of use (number of 
pods used per day) and e-cigarette dependence but not with the flavor or 
nicotine concentration of the e-liquids. Regulation of nicotine concentration of 
e-liquids is unlikely to influence nicotine exposure among adult experienced 
pod-mod users.

This study was designed to investigate the acute effects of nonnicotinized 
e-cigarette (e-cig) aerosol inhalation in nonsmokers both in terms of 
blood-based markers of inflammation and oxidative stress and evaluate their 
association with hemodynamic-metabolic MRI parameters quantifying peripheral 
vascular reactivity, cerebrovascular reactivity, and aortic stiffness. 
Thirty-one healthy nonsmokers were subjected to two blood draws and two 
identical MRI protocols, each one before and after a standardized e-cig vaping 
session. After vaping, the serum levels of C-reactive protein, soluble 
intercellular adhesion molecule, and the danger signal machinery high-mobility 
group box 1 (HMGB1) and its downstream effector and the NLR family pyrin domain 
containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome (as monitored by its adaptor protein ASC) 
increased significantly relative to the respective baseline (prevaping) values. 
Moreover, nitric oxide metabolites and reactive oxygen species production 
decreased and increased, respectively. These observations were paralleled by 
impaired peripheral vascular reactivity (with reduced flow-mediated dilation and 
attenuated hyperemic response after a cuff-occlusion test) and metabolic 
alterations expressed by decreased venous oxygen saturation, postvaping. The 
current results suggest propagation of inflammation signaling via activation of 
the danger signaling axis (HMGB1-NLRP3). The findings indicate that a single 
episode of vaping has adverse impacts on vascular inflammation and function.NEW 
& NOTWORTHY Endothelial cell signaling and blood biomarkers were found to 
correlate with functional vascular changes in a single episode e-cigarettes 
inhalation in healthy adults. This is indicative of the potential of 
e-cigarettes (even when inhaled acutely) to lead of vascular dysfunction.

BACKGROUND: Insulin resistance is associated with atrial remodeling as well as 
atrial fibrillation (AF). However, there was limited evidence on the 
relationship of triglyceride-glucose index (TyG) index, a simple, valuable 
marker of insulin resistance, with AF. Thus, we aimed to investigate the 
association between TyG index and AF among hospitalized patients.
METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted in Daping Hospital, 
which included 356 hospitalized patients from the Department of Cardiology. 
Clinical and biochemical parameters were collected from electronic medical 
records and AF was diagnosed from electrocardiogram (ECG) findings.
RESULTS: We found that the TyG index was significantly higher in the AF group 
than in the group without AF. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that 
hypertension (OR = 1.756, 95%CI 1.135-2.717, P = 0.011) and TyG index (OR = 
2.092, 95%CI 1.412-3.100, P<0.001) were positively associated with AF. The 
analysis of the area under the ROC curve was performed and revealed that area 
under curve (AUC) of TyG index was 0.600 (95%CI, 0.542-0.659, P = 0.001), the 
optimal critical value was 8.35, the sensitivity was 65.4%, and the specificity 
was 52.0%. Additional subgroup analyses of diabetic and non-diabetic subjects 
were also performed and found the TyG index was increased in non-diabetic 
subjects with AF. Furthermore, a logistic regression analysis showed TyG index 
was associated with AF (OR = 3.065, 95% CI, 1.819-5.166, P<0.001) in 
non-diabetic subjects. However, TyG index was not associated with AF in diabetic 
subjects.
CONCLUSION: Elevated TyG index is an independent risk factor for AF among 
non-diabetic hospitalized patients.

Despite claims of safety or harm reduction for electronic cigarettes (E-cig) use 
(also known as vaping), emerging evidence indicates that E-cigs are not likely 
safe, or necessarily safer than traditional cigarettes, when considering the 
user's risk of developing vascular dysfunction/disease. E-cigs are different 
from regular cigarettes in that E-cig devices are highly customizable, and users 
can change the e-liquid composition (such as the base solution, flavors, and 
nicotine level). Since the effects of E-cigs on the microvascular responses in 
skeletal muscle are poorly understood, we used intravital microscopy with an 
acute (one-time 10 puff) exposure paradigm to evaluate the individual components 
of e-liquid on vascular tone and endothelial function in the arterioles of the 
gluteus maximus muscle of anesthetized C57Bl/6 mice. Consistent with the 
molecular responses seen with endothelial cells, we found that the peripheral 
vasoconstriction response was similar between mice exposed to E-cig aerosol or 
cigarette smoke (i.e., 3R4F reference cigarette); this response was not nicotine 
dependent, and endothelial cell-mediated vasodilation was not altered within 
this acute exposure paradigm. We also report that, regardless of the base 
solution component [i.e., vegetable glycerin (VG)-only or propylene glycol 
(PG)-only], the vasoconstriction responses were the same in mice with inhalation 
exposure to 3R4F cigarette smoke or E-cig aerosol. Key findings from this work 
reveal that some component other than nicotine, in inhaled smoke or aerosol, is 
responsible for triggering peripheral vasoconstriction in skeletal muscle, and 
that regardless of one's preference for an E-cig base solution composition 
(i.e., ratio of VG-to-PG), the acute physiological response to blood vessels 
appears to be the same. The data suggest that vaping is not likely to be 'safer' 
than smoking towards blood vessels and can be expected to produce and/or result 
in the same adverse vascular health outcomes associated with smoking cigarettes.

INTRODUCTION: To evaluate the nicotine pharmacokinetics of a commercial 
electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) relative to conventional cigarettes in 
Chinese adult smokers.
AIMS AND METHODS: A randomized, open-label, crossover clinical study was 
conducted on 23 healthy adult Chinese smokers. In two sessions, subjects used 
either the e-cigarettes with 30 mg/g nicotine in e-liquid or conventional 
cigarettes of a given brand, at one puff every 30 seconds for a total of 10 
puffs. Blood samples were collected at specified time points for 4 hours after 
the first puff. Subjective effects on desire-to-smoke and physiological 
parameters such as heart rate and oxyhemoglobin saturation levels were also 
examined before and after using the two products.
RESULTS: The baseline-adjusted maximum nicotine concentration (Cmax-BL), 
time-to-peak nicotine concentration (Tmax), and nicotine absorption rate 
(Cmax-BL divided by Tmax) were found to be similar for the e-cigarette versus 
those of conventional cigarettes (p > .05). Total nicotine exposure measured as 
the area-under-curve (AUC0-t-BL) was significantly lower for the e-cigarette 
relative to that of conventional cigarettes. In addition, the subjects found 
that e-cigarettes were well tolerated under controlled puffing conditions.
CONCLUSIONS: The test e-cigarettes achieved similar nicotine delivery and 
pharmacokinetic profiles to those of the comparator cigarettes, indicating that 
this e-cigarette could be a potential alternative to conventional cigarettes for 
those adult smokers.
IMPLICATIONS: There are no data in the published literature on the nicotine 
pharmacokinetics of e-cigarettes in Chinese smokers. To the best of our 
knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the nicotine delivery and 
pharmacokinetic profile of a commercial e-cigarette brand compared with 
conventional cigarettes in Chinese adult smokers. After the use of test 
e-cigarettes, nicotine delivery and pharmacokinetic profile were similar to 
those of conventional cigarettes in Chinese adult smokers.

Univercity, Antalya, Turkey.

OBJECTIVE: Cigarette smoking is a life-threatening habit that has rapidly spread 
in every socioeconomic part of the public worldwide. There exist mechanisms of 
nicotine delivery available to use in the hope of halting cigarette smoking, and 
the electronic cigarette (EC) is one of the common methods used for tobacco 
smoking replacement. This study aimed to investigate experimentally the 
oxidative effects of tobacco smoke and EC smoke which contain nicotine.
METHOD: We constructed smoke circuit rooms for exposing the rats to EC or 
tobacco smoke. Three groups were created, the control group (N = 8); the 
electronic cigarette group (N = 8), exposure to electronic cigarette smoke for 2 
h per day; and the tobacco group (N = 8), exposure to traditional cigarette 
smoke for 2 h per day. After the first and second week of exposure, blood 
samples were obtained, and serum oxidative stress index (OSI), paraoxonase 1 
(PON1) activity, and prolidase levels were evaluated.
RESULTS: Higher values of OSI and prolidase levels were detected in the first 
week of EC or tobacco smoke exposure in both study groups (p < 0.001) when 
compared with the control group, and partial decrements were observed in the 
second week. By contrast, elevated PON1 levels were observed in the second week 
after EC or tobacco smoke exposure. The highest OSI levels were observed in the 
tobacco smoke group (p < 0.001). The lowest values of PON1 levels were detected 
in the first week of the electronic cigarette smoke group, and this decremental 
value was statistically different than normal, the second week of the electronic 
cigarette smoke group, the first week of the traditional cigarette smoke 
exposure group, and the second week of the traditional cigarette smoke exposure 
group values (p < 0.000).
CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that EC smoke induced oxidative stress. 
Therefore, ECs are potentially risky for human health and can lead to important 
health problems.

INTRODUCTION: Electronic cigarettes (ECIGs) aerosolise a liquid that usually 
contains propylene glycol and/or vegetable glycerine, flavourants and the 
dependence-producing drug, nicotine, in various concentrations. This laboratory 
study examined the relationship between liquid nicotine concentration and plasma 
nicotine concentration and puffing behaviour in experienced ECIG users.
METHODS: Sixteen ECIG-experienced participants used a 3.3-Volt ECIG battery 
attached to a 1.5-Ohm dual-coil 'cartomiser' loaded with 1 mL of a flavoured 
propylene glycol/vegetable glycerine liquid to complete four sessions, at least 
2 days apart, that differed by nicotine concentration (0, 8, 18 or 36 mg/mL). In 
each session, participants completed two 10-puff ECIG-use bouts (30 s puff 
interval) separated by 60 min. Venous blood was sampled to determine plasma 
nicotine concentration. Puff duration, volume and average flow rate were 
measured.
RESULTS: Immediately after bout 1, mean plasma nicotine concentration was 
5.5 ng/mL (SD=7.7) for 0 mg/mL liquid, with significantly (p<0.05) higher mean 
concentrations observed for the 8 (mean=17.8 ng/mL, SD=14.6), 18 
(mean=25.9 ng/mL, SD=17.5) and 36 mg/mL (mean=30.2 ng/mL; SD=20.0) 
concentrations; a similar pattern was observed for bout 2. For bout 1, at 
36 mg/mL, the mean post- minus pre-bout difference was 24.1 ng/mL (SD=18.3). 
Puff topography data were consistent with previous results and revealed few 
reliable differences across conditions.
DISCUSSION: This study demonstrates a relationship between ECIG liquid nicotine 
concentration and user plasma nicotine concentration in experienced ECIG users. 
Nicotine delivery from some ECIGs may exceed that of a combustible cigarette. 
The rationale for this higher level of nicotine delivery is uncertain.

AIMS: To assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of, and users' reactions to, 
Juul (59 mg nicotine/ml) as an indication of its therapeutic and dependence 
potential.
DESIGN: Cross-over, within-subjects study in which participants attended after 
overnight abstinence on separate sessions and smoked a cigarette or used Juul or 
eight other types of e-cigarettes (EC) ad libitum for 5 minutes. The Juul 
product used was the version available in the United States that has more 
nicotine in the e-liquid than the one available in the European Union.
SETTING: Laboratory setting in the United Kingdom.
PARTICIPANTS: Twenty dual users (smokers who also vape) provided data on Juul 
and cigarettes, with eight also providing data on other EC products.
MEASUREMENTS: At each session, number of puffs taken was counted during the 
5-minute product use period and blood samples were taken at baseline and at 2, 
4, 6, 8, 10 and 30 minutes after starting smoking/vaping and analysed for 
nicotine. Participants also monitored their urges to smoke and rated the 
products on a range of characteristics.
FINDINGS: Juul's PK profile was close to the PK profile of cigarettes [maximum 
concentration (Cmax ) = 20.4 versus 19.2 ng/ml; time to maximum concentration 
(Tmax ) = 4 versus 6 minutes; area under the curve (AUC): 307.9 versus 312.6, 
respectively]. Compared with other EC products, Juul had shorter Tmax [4 
minutes, (IQR = 2.5-4.0) versus 6.3 minutes, (IQR = 4.7 - 8.1), P = 0.012] and 
higher Cmax (28.9 (SD = 15.6) versus 10.6 (SD = 5.5), P = 0.013) despite a lower 
number of puffs (12.5 (SD = 4.2) versus 17.0 (SD = 4.2), P = 0.084). Compared 
with other e-cigarette products, it also provided faster reduction of urges to 
smoke and obtained more favourable subjective ratings.
CONCLUSION: Juul's PK profile and user ratings suggest that it could be more 
effective than other EC products in helping smokers to quit smoking, but it may 
also have a higher potential to generate regular use in non-smokers.

BACKGROUND: Smoking is the main preventable cause of death in the United States 
and worldwide and is associated with serious cardiovascular health consequences, 
including thrombotic diseases. Recently, electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) 
and, in particular JUUL, have attained wide popularity among smokers, 
nonsmokers, pregnant females, and even the youth, which is alarming. 
Interestingly, there is/are no information/studies regarding the effect of JUUL 
on cardiovascular diseases, specifically in the context of modulation of 
platelet activation. Thus, it is important to discern the cardiovascular disease 
health risks associated with JUUL.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We used a passive e-vape vapor inhalation system where 
C57BL/6J mice (10-12 weeks old) were exposed to JUUL e-cigarette vape. Menthol 
flavored JUUL pods containing 5% nicotine by weight were used as the e-liquid. 
Mice were exposed to a total of 70 puffs daily for 2 weeks; 3-second puff 
duration, and 25-second puff interval. The effects of JUUL relative to clean air 
were analyzed, on mouse platelet function in vitro (eg, aggregation) and in vivo 
(eg, FeCl3-induced carotid artery injury thrombosis model). Our results indicate 
that short-term exposure to JUUL e-cigarette causes hyperactivation of platelets 
and shortens the thrombus occlusion as well as hemostasis/bleeding times, 
relative to clean air (medians of 14 vs. 200 seconds, P < .01 and 35 vs. 295 
seconds, P < .001, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Our findings document-for the first time-that short-term exposure to 
the JUUL e-cigarette increases the risk of thrombotic events, in part by 
modulating platelet function, such as aggregation and secretion, in mice.

As electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) become increasingly popular smoking 
devices, there is an increased risk for unintended exposure to e-cigarette 
liquids through improper disposal resulting in leaching into the environment, 
third hand vapor exposure through air, or embryonic exposure through maternal 
vaping. Thus, the safety of e-cigarettes for wildlife and developing embryos 
need to be thoroughly investigated. We examined perturbations in zebrafish 
embryonic development after exposures to two cinnamon flavored vaping liquids 
(with 12 mg/ml nicotine and without nicotine) for e-cigarettes from two 
different vendors, as well as the flavoring chemical cinnamaldehyde. We focused 
on the effects of the vaping liquids on hatching success and bone, cartilage and 
blood vessel development in 3-4 days old transgenic zebrafish larvae. We found 
that exposures to both of the vaping liquids perturbed the development of the 
cleithrum and craniofacial cartilage. Exposure to the liquids further caused 
non-overlapping and partially or completely missing intersegmental vessels. 
Hatching success was also reduced. Exposure to pure cinnamaldehyde replicated 
the effects of the vaping liquids with a 50% effect concentration (EC50) of 
34-41 µM. Quantification of the amount of cinnamaldehyde in the vaping liquids 
by mass spectrometry revealed EC50s around 10-40 times lower than for pure 
cinnamaldehyde, suggesting that additional compounds or metabolites present in 
the vaping liquids mediate toxicity. Presence of nicotine in one of the vaping 
liquids decreased its EC50s about two fold compared to the liquid without 
nicotine. Exposure to the humectants propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin did 
not affect the vascular, cartilage or bone development in zebrafish embryos. In 
conclusion, our study shows that exposure to cinnamaldehyde containing vaping 
liquids causes severe tissue-specific defects in developing embryos.

BACKGROUND: Delivering nicotine in the way smokers seek is likely to be the key 
factor in e-cigarette (EC) success in replacing cigarettes. We examined to what 
degree different types of EC mimic nicotine intake from cigarettes.
METHODS: Twelve participants ('dual users' of EC and cigarettes) used their own 
brand cigarette and nine different EC brands. Blood samples were taken at 
baseline and at 2-min intervals for 10 min and again at 30 min.
RESULTS: Eleven smokers provided usable data. None of the EC matched cigarettes 
in nicotine delivery (C max = 17.9 ng/ml, T max = 4 min and 
AUC0->30 = 315 ng/ml/min). The EC with 48 mg/ml nicotine generated the closest 
PK profile (C max = 13.6 ng/ml, T max = 4 min, AUC0->30 = 245 ng/ml/min), 
followed by a third generation EC using 20 mg/ml nicotine (C max = 11.9 ng/ml, T 
max = 6 min, AUC0->30 = 232 ng/ml/min), followed by the tank system using 
20 mg/ml nicotine (C max = 9.9 ng/ml, T max = 6 min, AUC0->30 = 201 ng/ml/min). 
Cig-a-like PK values were similar, ranging from C max 7.5 to 9.7 ng/ml, T max 
4-6 min, and AUC0->30 144 to 173 ng/ml/min. Moderate differences in e-liquid 
nicotine concentrations had little effect on nicotine delivery, e.g. the EC with 
24 mg/ml cartridge had the same PK profile as ECs with 16 mg/ml cartridges. 
Using similar strength e-liquid, the tank EC provided significantly more 
nicotine than cig-a-like ECs.
CONCLUSIONS: EC brands we tested do not deliver nicotine as efficiently as 
cigarettes, but newer EC products deliver nicotine more efficiently than 
cig-a-like brands. Moderate variations in nicotine content of e-liquid have 
little effect on nicotine delivery. Smokers who are finding cig-a-like EC 
unsatisfactory should be advised to try more advanced systems.

The popularity of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) is rapidly increasing in 
many countries. These devices are designed to imitate regular cigarettes, 
delivering nicotine via inhalation without combusting tobacco but currently, 
there is a lack of scientific evidence on the presence or absence of nicotine 
exposure. Such research relies on evidence from e-cigarette users urine samples. 
In this study, we aimed to determine the levels and compare the amount of 
nicotine to which e-cigarette users, cigarette smokers and passive smokers are 
exposed. Therefore, urine samples were collected from e-cigarette users, 
cigarette smokers, passive smokers, and healthy nonsmokers. The urinary cotinine 
levels of the subjects were determined using gas chromatography-mass 
spectrometry. The mean (±SD) urinary cotinine levels were determined as 
1755 ± 1848 ng/g creatinine for 32 e-cigarette users, 1720 ± 1335 ng/g 
creatinine for 33 cigarette smokers and 81.42 ± 97.90 ng/g creatinine for 33 
passive smokers. A significant difference has been found between cotinine levels 
of e-cigarette users and passive smokers (p < 0.05). There were no statistically 
significant differences between e-cigarette users and cigarette smokers 
(p > 0.05). This is a seminal study to demonstrate the e-cigarette users are 
exposed to nicotine as much as cigarette smokers.

INTRODUCTION: Vaping emerges as alternative to standard tobacco smoking. 
However, there is evidence for critical cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and 
respiratory side effects. Nevertheless, long-term vaping effects on thrombocyte 
reactivity have not been investigated. Therefore, we investigated the influence 
of vaping on thrombocyte reactivity in comparison to standard smoking and 
non-smoking.
METHODS: Platelet function was measured by Multiplate Impedance Aggregometry as 
area under the curve (AUC). Smoking habits and characteristics were assessed by 
questionnaire. Results were analyzed using inverse probability of treatment 
weighting (IPTW) and conventional t-tests to test for robustness.
RESULTS: After IPTW adjustment, participants in all groups were balanced by age, 
gender, body height and weight. Collagen-induced aggregation was higher in 
vapers compared to non-smokers (non-smokers 52.55 ± 23.97 vs. vapers 
66.63 ± 18.96 AUC, p = 0.002) and to smokers (vapers vs. smokers 49.50 ± 26.05 
AUC, p < 0.0001). ADP-induced aggregation in vapers was higher compared to 
non-smokers (non-smokers 33.16 ± 16.61 vs. vapers 45.27 ± 18.67 AUC, p = 0.001) 
and was numerically increased compared to smokers (vapers vs. smokers 
40.09 ± 19.80 AUC, p = 0.08). These findings remained robust in t-test analysis.
CONCLUSION: This study provides first evidence that vaping leads to enhanced 
platelet reactivity compared to standard smoking and non-smoking. This suggests 
health effects of vaping might be more severe than previously assumed. Whether 
this effect translates to clinical outcome with a higher incidence of major 
cardiovascular events, should be evaluated in large-scaled clinical studies.

As with other tobacco aerosols, nicotine delivery from e-cigarettes (ECIG) 
depends on the total nicotine and its partitioning between free-base (Nic) and 
protonated (NicH(+)) forms. Previous studies of ECIG nicotine emissions have 
generally reported "nicotine yield" without attention to whether the methods 
employed resulted in quantification of the total nicotine or only one of its 
forms, making reported results difficult to compare across studies or to 
evaluate against reported blood exposure. This study reports a convenient 
solvent extraction method for determining total nicotine and its partitioning in 
ECIG liquids and aerosols by gas chromatography. Commercial ECIG liquids and 
aerosols were analyzed, and it was found that most of the nicotine was in the 
Nic form, with aerosols exhibiting higher Nic fraction than the parent liquids. 
Apparent pH was found to correlate with nicotine partitioning and can provide a 
useful indirect measure when chromatography is unavailable. Finally, labeled 
ECIG liquid nicotine concentration in commercial products was often inconsistent 
with measured nicotine.

We recently reported a mouse model of chronic electronic cigarette (e-cig) 
exposure-induced cardiovascular pathology, where long-term exposure to e-cig 
vape (ECV) induces cardiac abnormalities, impairment of endothelial function, 
and systemic hypertension. Here, we delineate the underlying mechanisms of 
ECV-induced vascular endothelial dysfunction (VED), a central trigger of 
cardiovascular disease. C57/BL6 male mice were exposed to ECV generated from 
e-cig liquid containing 0, 6, or 24 mg/mL nicotine for 16 and 60 wk. 
Time-dependent elevation in blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance were 
observed, along with an impairment of acetylcholine-induced aortic relaxation in 
ECV-exposed mice, compared with air-exposed control. Decreased intravascular 
nitric oxide (NO) levels and increased superoxide generation with elevated 
3-nitrotyrosine levels in the aorta of ECV-exposed mice were observed, 
indicating that ECV-induced superoxide reacts with NO to generate cytotoxic 
peroxynitrite. Exposure increased NADPH oxidase expression, supporting its role 
in ECV-induced superoxide generation. Downregulation of endothelial nitric oxide 
synthase (eNOS) expression and Akt-dependent eNOS phosphorylation occurred in 
the aorta of ECV-exposed mice, indicating that exposure inhibited de novo NO 
synthesis. Following ECV exposure, the critical NOS cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin 
was decreased, with a concomitant loss of its salvage enzyme, dihydrofolate 
reductase. NADPH oxidase and NOS inhibitors abrogated ECV-induced superoxide 
generation in the aorta of ECV-exposed mice. Together, our data demonstrate that 
ECV exposure activates NADPH oxidase and uncouples eNOS, causing a vicious cycle 
of superoxide generation and vascular oxidant stress that triggers VED and 
hypertension with predisposition to other cardiovascular disease.NEW & 
NOTEWORTHY Underlying mechanisms of e-cig-induced vascular endothelial 
dysfunction are delineated. e-cig exposure activates and increases expression of 
NADPH oxidase and disrupts activation and coupling of eNOS, leading to a vicious 
cycle of superoxide generation and peroxynitrite formation, with 
tetrahydrobiopterin depletion, causing loss of NO that triggers vascular 
endothelial dysfunction. This process is progressive, increasing with the 
duration of e-cig exposure, and is more severe in the presence of nicotine, but 
observed even with nicotine-free vaping.

Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), also commonly known as electronic 
cigarettes (e-cigs) are considered in most cases as a safer alternative to 
tobacco smoking and therefore have become extremely popular among all age groups 
and sex. It is estimated that up to 15% of pregnant women are now using e-cigs 
in the US which keeps increasing at an alarming rate. Harmful effects of tobacco 
smoking during pregnancy are well documented for both pregnancy and postnatal 
health, however limited preclinical and clinical studies exist to evaluate the 
long-term effects of prenatal e-cig exposure on postnatal health. Therefore, the 
aim of our study is to evaluate the effect of maternal e-cig use on postnatal 
blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity and behavioral outcomes of mice of varying 
age and sex. In this study, pregnant CD1 mice (E5) were exposed to e-Cig vapor 
(2.4% nicotine) until postnatal day (PD) 7. Weight of the offspring was measured 
at PD0, PD7, PD15, PD30, PD45, PD60 and PD90. The expression of structural 
elements of the BBB, tight junction proteins (ZO-1, claudin-5, occludin), 
astrocytes (GFAP), pericytes (PDGFRβ) and the basement membrane (laminin α1, 
laminin α4), neuron specific marker (NeuN), water channel protein (AQP4) and 
glucose transporter (GLUT1) were analyzed in both male and female offspring 
using western blot and immunofluorescence. Estrous cycle was recorded by vaginal 
cytology method. Long-term motor and cognitive functions were evaluated using 
open field test (OFT), novel object recognition test (NORT) and morris water 
maze test (MWMT) at adolescence (PD 40-45) and adult (PD 90-95) age. In our 
study, significantly reduced expression of tight junction proteins and astrocyte 
marker were observed in male and female offspring until PD 90 (P < 0.05). 
Additionally, prenatally e-cig exposed adolescent and adult offspring showed 
impaired locomotor, learning, and memory function compared to control offspring 
(P < 0.05). Our findings suggest that prenatal e-cig exposure induces long-term 
neurovascular changes of neonates by disrupting postnatal BBB integrity and 
worsening behavioral outcomes.

We examined the effects of electronic cigarette on platelet and vascular 
function after 4 months of use compared to tobacco smoking. Forty smokers 
without cardiovascular disease were randomized to smoke either conventional 
cigarettes or an electronic cigarette (nicotine concentration of 12 mg/ml). At 
baseline and after four months, we measured a) platelet function by Platelet 
Function Analyzer PFA-100 and Light Transmission Aggregometry, b) pulse wave 
velocity, c) plasma malondialdehyde levels as oxidative stress index and d) the 
exhaled CO level. After 4 months, continuation of conventional cigarette smoking 
further impaired platelet function compared to vaping as assessed by PFA (mean 
increase 27.1 vs 11.6 s, p for interaction = 0.048) and by LTA (decline 24.1 vs 
9.4%, p for interaction = 0.045). Conversely, compared to smoking, vaping 
resulted in greater reduction of exhaled CO (6.9 ppm vs 2.6, p for 
interaction < 0.001), improvement of PWV (decrease of 0.8 m/s vs increase of 
0.8 m/s, p for interaction = 0.020) and reduction of MDA (reduction 0.13 vs 
increase 0.19 nmol/L, p for interaction = 0.035). Switching to electronic 
cigarette for 4 months has a neutral effect on platelet function while it 
reduces arterial stiffness and oxidative stress compared to tobacco smoking.

A 33-year-old man without significant medical history presented to the emergency 
department with a 6-month history of fatigue and 30 pounds of unintentional 
weight loss, with a recent cough and fever over the past week. He recalled two 
similar illnesses during college that did not require medical care. He denied 
tobacco use but reported inhaling marijuana 1-2 times daily over the past year 
with a vaping device. Physical exam was notable for a temperature of 100.0°F and 
an elevated blood pressure at 161/77 mm Hg. He was diaphoretic with clear breath 
sounds bilaterally. Chest imaging revealed diffuse ground glass opacities with 
subpleural sparing and mildly enlarged hilar lymph nodes. Bronchoscopy with 
transbronchial lung biopsies and needle aspirate of lymph nodes revealed 
organising pneumonia, and subsequent cultures grew Actinomyces odontolyticus He 
was treated with amoxicillin and corticosteroids with subsequent resolution on 
repeat chest imaging.

The emergence of e-cigarettes on the consumer market led to a tremendous rise in 
e-cigarette consumption among adolescents in the United States. The success of 
JUUL and other pod systems was linked to its high nicotine delivery capacity. In 
compliance with the European Tobacco Product directive, liquid nicotine contents 
in the European JUUL variants are limited to 20 mg/mL or below. A short time 
after launching the initial version in Europe, JUUL pods have been modified in 
terms of the wick material used. This modification has been demonstrated 
previously to lead to an elevated aerosol generation, consequently, to a larger 
amount of nicotine per puff generated. The present study was designed to assess 
whether the mentioned differences between the "initial" and "modified" JUUL 
versions may cause a significant difference during consumption, and how nicotine 
delivery compares with tobacco cigarettes. In this single-center three-arm 
study, nicotine pharmacokinetics and influence on urge to smoke/vape were 
compared for tobacco cigarettes, the "initial" version of the European JUUL, and 
the "modified" version of the European JUUL. Participants, 15 active smokers and 
17 active e-cigarette users, were instructed to consume their study product 
according to a pre-directed puffing protocol. Venous blood was sampled for 
nicotine analysis to cover the acute phase and the first 30 min after starting. 
Nicotine delivery and the reduction of urge to smoke/vape upon usage of both 
European JUUL variants were lower in comparison to tobacco cigarettes. This 
suggests a lower addictive potential. Modification of the pod design did not 
result in significant differences at the first ten puffs, as confirmed by a 
vaping machine experiment. Apparently, the limitations by the initially used 
wick material only come into effect after longer usage time.

Atherosclerosis is a complex process involving progressive pathological events, 
including monocyte adhesion to the luminal endothelial surface. We have 
developed a functional in vitro adhesion assay using BioFlux microfluidic 
technology to investigate THP-1 (human acute monocytic leukaemia cell) monocyte 
adhesion to human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs). The effect of whole smoke 
conditioned media (WSCM) generated from University of Kentucky reference 
cigarette 3R4F, electronic cigarette vapour conditioned media (eVCM) from an 
electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) product (Vype ePen) and nicotine on 
monocyte adhesion to HAECs was evaluated. Endothelial monolayers were grown in 
microfluidic channels and exposed to 0-1500 ng/mL nicotine or nicotine 
equivalence of WSCM or eVCM for 24 h. Activated THP-1 cells were perfused 
through the channels and a perfusion, adhesion period and wash cycle performed 
four times with increasing adhesion period lengths (10, 20, 30 and 40 min). 
THP-1 cell adhesion was quantified by counting adherent cells. WSCM induced 
dose-dependent increases in monocyte adhesion compared to vehicle control. No 
such increases were observed for eVCM or nicotine. Adhesion regulation was 
linked to increased ICAM-1 protein expression. Staining of ICAM-1 in HAECs and 
CD11b (MAC-1) in THP-1 cells demonstrated adhesion molecule co-localisation in 
BioFlux plates. The ICAM-1 adhesion response to WSCM was downregulated by 
transfecting HAECs with ICAM-1 siRNA. We conclude that the BioFlux system is 
able to model human monocyte adhesion to primary human endothelial cells in 
vitro and WSCM drives the greatest increase in monocyte adhesion via a mechanism 
involving endothelial ICAM-1 expression.

OBJECTIVES: To describe the effect of e-liquid flavors on nicotine intake and 
pharmacology of e-cigarettes.
METHODS: 11 males and 3 females participated in a 3-day inpatient crossover 
study with strawberry, tobacco, and their usual flavor e-liquid. Nicotine levels 
were nominally 18mg/mL in the strawberry (pH 8.29) and tobacco (pH 9.10) 
e-liquids and ranged between 3-18mg/mL in the usual brands (mean pH 6.80). Each 
day consisted of a 15-puff session followed by 4h of abstinence, then 90min of 
ad libitum use. Subjects used a KangerTech mini ProTank 3.
RESULTS: After 15 puffs, the amount of nicotine inhaled and systemically 
retained were not significantly different between the strawberry and tobacco 
e-liquids but plasma AUC(0→180) was significantly higher with the strawberry 
e-liquid. While not significantly different, Cmax was 22% higher and various 
early time point AUCs to measure rate of rise of nicotine in blood ranged 
between 17 and 23% higher with the strawberry e-liquid compared to the tobacco 
e-liquid. During ad libitum use, systemic exposure to nicotine (AUC(0→90)) was 
the same for the tobacco and usual brand e-liquids but were both significantly 
lower than after using the strawberry e-liquid. The usual flavors were more 
liked and satisfying than the strawberry and tobacco e-liquids.
CONCLUSION: Flavors influence nicotine exposure through flavor liking, may 
affect rate of nicotine absorption possibly through pH effects, and contribute 
to heart rate acceleration and subjective effects of e-cigarettes. E-cigarette 
users titrate their nicotine exposure but the extent of titration may vary 
across flavors.

Combustible tobacco use has reached historic lows, demonstrating the importance 
of proven strategies to reduce smoking since publication of the 1964 Surgeon 
General's report. In contrast, the use of electronic nicotine delivery systems 
(ENDS), specifically e-cigarettes, has grown to alarming rates and threatens to 
hinder progress against tobacco use. A major concern is ENDS use by youth and 
adults who never previously used tobacco. While ENDS emit fewer carcinogens than 
combustible tobacco, preliminary evidence links ENDS use to DNA damage and 
inflammation, key steps in cancer development. Furthermore, high levels of 
nicotine can also increase addiction, raise blood pressure, interfere with brain 
development, and suppress the immune system. The magnitude of long-term health 
risks will remain unknown until longitudinal studies are completed. ENDS have 
been billed as a promising tool for combustible tobacco cessation, but further 
evidence is needed to assess their potential efficacy for adults who smoke. Of 
concern, epidemiological studies estimate that approximately 15% to 42% of 
adults who use ENDS have never used another tobacco product, and another 36% to 
54% "dual use" both ENDS and combustible tobacco. This policy statement details 
advances in science related to ENDS and calls for urgent action to end predatory 
practices of the tobacco industry and protect public health. Importantly, we 
call for an immediate ban on all non-tobacco-flavored ENDS products that contain 
natural or synthetic nicotine to reduce ENDS use by youth and adults who never 
previously used tobacco. Concurrently, evidence-based treatments to promote 
smoking cessation and prevent smoking relapse to reduce cancer incidence and 
improve public health remain top priorities for our organizations. We also 
recognize there is an urgent need for research to understand the relationship 
between ENDS and tobacco-related disparities.

PURPOSE: This study examined changes in e-cigarette and dual-use frequency, 
levels of nicotine exposure and e-cigarette dependence, and device and e-liquid 
preferences over 12 months.
METHODS: Adolescents (N = 173, aged 13-18 years) who reported past-month 
e-cigarette use and at least 10 lifetime uses were recruited from the San 
Francisco Bay Area. The sample was 75.1% male, 54.9% non-Hispanic White, mean 
age 16.6 years (standard deviation = 1.2); 26.6% reported past-month cigarette 
smoking at baseline (i.e., dual use). At baseline, 6-month, and 12-month 
follow-up, participants provided saliva samples for cotinine testing and 
self-reported e-cigarette use frequency, dependence, past-month smoking, product 
preference, and flavor preference.
RESULTS: Most (80.3%) were still using e-cigarettes at 12 months, and daily use 
increased from 14.5% to 29.8%. Model testing indicated an overall increase from 
baseline to 12 months in frequency of e-cigarette use (F(2, 166) = 5.69, p = 
.004), dependence (F(2, 164) = 5.49, p = .005), and cotinine levels (F(2, 103) = 
4.40, p = .038). Among those reporting only e-cigarette use at baseline, 28.8% 
reported combustible cigarette use during follow-up. Among those reporting dual 
use at baseline, 57.1% were still dual using at 12 months, 31.4% reported 
e-cigarette use only, and none abstained from both products. Higher nicotine 
delivering e-cigarette devices (i.e., Juul, mods) became more popular over time, 
whereas flavor preferences (i.e., fruit, mint/menthol, and candy) remained 
stable.
CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents' e-cigarette use persisted over a 12-month period with 
significant increases in frequency of use, nicotine exposure, and e-cigarette 
dependence. Transitions from single to dual and dual to single nicotine product 
use were observed in approximately one in three users over the study period.

Electronic cigarette (EC) has been suggested to be less harmful than cigarette 
smoking, but the research on the full extent of their harm reduction potential 
is still lacking. This study aimed to evaluate the influence of EC aerosol and 
cigarette smoke (CS) on cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and renal functions in 
mice after prolonged exposure. Forty-eight C57BL/6J male mice were randomly 
grouped and then exposed to fresh air (control), mung bean-flavored EC aerosol 
with low and high dose (EC1L, 6 mg/kg; EC1H, 12 mg/kg), watermelon-flavored EC 
aerosol with low and high dose (EC2L, 6 mg/kg; EC2H, 12 mg/kg), and finally a 
cigarette smoke (CS, 6 mg/kg), respectively. After 10 weeks of exposure, the 
heart rate increased for both the EC and CS groups, and the effect of CS on 
blood oxygen saturation was significantly higher than that of the EC group 
(P < 0.01). Proteomic analysis of the heart tissue showed that the overlapped 
differential expression protein from the EC and CS exposures was Crip2. For the 
gastrointestinal system, oral mucosa was significantly damaged in CS group. 
Compare with CS, EC had significantly fewer negative effects on most of the 
indictors which focused on in this study.

Despite the lack of knowledge of the effects of electronic cigarettes 
(e-cigarettes, e-cigs) on public health, they have been proposed as a part of 
smoking cessation efforts. Recently, several basic scientific studies have 
pointed out how e-cigs can generate carcinogens, such as e-cig liquid thermal 
degradation by-products, and how the exposure can lead to genomic damage through 
inhibiting DNA repair or disrupting the redox homeostasis. However, scientific 
studies have pointed out how e-cigs can generate carcinogens and their release 
could be avoided setting the device to a low-voltage regimen. To test this 
feasibility, we show the effects of e-cig vapour generated from a low-voltage 
device filled with a nicotine-free liquid on rat testicular functions. The 
chemical analysis revealed the presence of carbonyls, such as formaldehyde, 
acetaldehyde and acrolein. Rats exposed reported a lower relative testis weight 
and higher levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) as tissue damage marker, along 
with an impairment of 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD), 
17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17β-HSD) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 
(G6PDH) as key enzymes in the steroidogenesis pathway. The pro-oxidative 
environment was confirmed by the higher amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS), 
the development of lipid peroxidation and protein carbonylation, as well as from 
the disruption of antioxidant capability. Finally, we observed a higher rate of 
DNA unwinding in white blood cell line and boosted lipoxygenase (LOX)-linked 
activity, a tumour promotion marker. Even with the device setting at weak 
conditions, our results if extrapolated to humans suggest that exposure to e-cig 
vapours might alter gonads function in male vapers.

Research on tobacco use disorder relies on a combination of self-reported use 
(e.g., cigarettes per day) and biochemical validation to quantify heaviness of 
use. However, electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) users may be unaware of 
how much they have vaped per day. The aim of this study was to test the 
relationship between self-reported heaviness of ENDS/tobacco use and nicotine 
biomarkers. Young adults (n = 30) who currently use ENDS and other tobacco 
products completed a detailed tobacco use history, timeline follow-back, and an 
ENDS topography session. We evaluated the self-reports of own-brand ENDS use and 
tested correlations to determine which self-report measures of own-brand use, 
and which self-reported measures of puff topography, had the strongest 
correlations with urine and/or blood biomarkers of nicotine use. Participants 
reported using a variety of different ENDS devices and had a range of usage. The 
sum of the self-reported number of occasions or hours of ENDS use, along with 
the number of cigarettes and other tobacco products used, over the past 24 hr 
was significantly correlated with plasma cotinine levels. Puff topography 
measures correlated with increased nicotine concentrations, although 
participants underestimated the number of puffs they took during the topography 
session. This study provides preliminary evidence that summing together the 
hours of ENDS use, or the number of occasions of ENDS use, in addition to the 
number of other tobacco products used (i.e., cigarettes) based on self-report 
may be an accurate method of quantification. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023

NEW FINDINGS: What is the central question of this study? Acute exposure to 
electronic cigarettes (Ecigs) triggers abnormal vascular responses in systemic 
arteries; however, effects on cerebral vessels are poorly understood and time 
for recovery is not known. We hypothesized that exposure to cigarettes or Ecigs 
would trigger rapid (<4 h) impairment of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) but 
that this would resolve by 24 h. What is the main finding and its importance? 
Cigarettes and Ecigs caused similar degree and duration of MCA impairment. We 
find it takes ~72 hours after exposure for MCA function to return to normal. 
This suggests that Ecig use is likely to produce similar adverse vascular health 
outcomes to those seen with cigarette smoke.
ABSTRACT: Temporal influences of electronic cigarettes (Ecigs) on blood vessels 
are poorly understood. In this study, we evaluated a single episode of cigarette 
versus Ecig exposure on middle cerebral artery (MCA) reactivity and determined 
how long after the exposure MCA responses took to return to normal. We 
hypothesized that cigarette and Ecig exposure would induce rapid (<4 h) 
reduction in MCA endothelial function and would resolve within 24 h. 
Sprague-Dawley rats (4 months old) were exposed to either air (n = 5), 
traditional cigarettes (20 puffs, n = 16) or Ecigs (20-puff group, n = 16; or 
60-puff group, n = 12). Thereafter, the cigarette and Ecig groups were randomly 
assigned for postexposure vessel myography testing on day 0 (D0, 1-4 h 
postexposure), day 1 (D1, 24-28 h postexposure), day 2 (D2, 48-52 h 
postexposure) and day 3 (72-76 h postexposure). The greatest effect on 
endothelium-dependent dilatation was observed within 24 h of exposure (∼50% 
decline between D0 and D1) for both cigarette and Ecig groups, and impairment 
persisted with all groups for up to 3 days. Changes in endothelium-independent 
dilatation responses were less severe (∼27%) and shorter lived (recovering by 
D2) compared with endothelium-dependent dilatation responses. Vasoconstriction 
in response to serotonin (5-HT) was similar to endothelium-independent 
dilatation, with greatest impairment (∼45% for all exposure groups) at D0-D1, 
returning to normal by D2. These data show that exposure to cigarettes and Ecigs 
triggers a similar level/duration of cerebrovascular dysfunction after a single 
exposure. The finding that Ecig (without nicotine) and cigarette (with nicotine) 
exposure produce the same effects suggesting that nicotine is not likely to be 
triggering MCA dysfunction, and that vaping (with/without nicotine) has 
potential to produce the same vascular harm and/or disease as smoking.

This study aims to compare serum cotinine levels in e-cigarette and combustible 
cigarette smokers, in an attempt to quantify the potential chronic nicotine 
addiction risk that e-cigarettes pose. We analyzed 428 participants in 2015-2016 
NHANES: 379 (87.03%) smoked combustible cigarettes alone and 49 (12.97%) smoked 
e-cigarettes. Serum cotinine levels were measured by isotope-dilution 
high-performance liquid chromatography/atmospheric pressure chemical ionization 
tandem mass spectrometric method with a detection limit of 0.015 ng/ml. 
Electronic cigarette smokers were younger than combustible cigarette smokers 
(mean age 36.79 versus 42.69 years, P = 0.03), more likely to be male (64.93% 
versus 48.32%, P = 0.09) and significantly less likely to live with other 
smokers (50.17% versus 90.07%, P < 0.01). Serum cotinine levels increased 
linearly with self-reported days of smoking in both electronic cigarette and 
combustible cigarette smokers, after accounting for living with a smoker. The 
analysis of the subgroup who reported daily use show non-statistically 
significantly higher serum cotinine levels in electronic cigarette smokers 
versus combustible cigarette smokers (β adj = 52.50, P = 0.10). This analysis of 
recent US data demonstrates that electronic cigarettes expose users to nicotine 
levels proportionate to, and potentially higher than combustible cigarettes, and 
thus pose a serious risk of chronic nicotine addiction. This could be 
particularly relevant in otherwise tobacco naive individuals; future risk of 
tobacco-related dependence, addiction and relapse, as well as of tobacco-related 
cancers in these subjects needs to be investigated.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: E-cigarette use is increasingly common. Whether 
e-cigarettes are harmful to human health is an intensely debated subject. In 
order to investigate whether e-cigarettes with and without nicotine cause 
different vascular responses, we obtained blood samples from healthy young 
volunteers who performed brief active e-cigarette inhalations. Extracellular 
vesicles (EVs) of endothelial and platelet origin were measured to determine 
vascular changes.
METHODS: Using a randomized, double-blind, crossover design, 17 healthy 
occasional smokers inhaled 30 puffs of e-cigarette vapor during 30 min. Blood 
samples were collected at baseline, as well as at 0, 2, 4 and 6 h post-exposure. 
EVs from platelets and endothelial cells were measured by flow cytometry.
RESULTS: Platelet and endothelial derived EVs were significantly increased with 
peak levels seen at 4 h following exposure to active inhalation of e-cigarette 
vapor with nicotine. Moreover, platelet derived EVs, expressing platelet 
activation marker P-selectin and the inflammation marker, CD40 ligand, were also 
significantly increased following inhalation of e-cigarette vapor with nicotine. 
In addition, platelet derived EVs expressing CD40 ligand was increased after 
inhalation of e-cigarette vapor without nicotine.
CONCLUSION: As few as 30 puffs of nicotine-containing e-cigarette vapor caused 
an increase in levels of circulating EVs of endothelial and platelet origin, 
which may signify underlying vascular changes. Although e-cigarette vapor 
without nicotine caused an increase in platelet EVs expressing CD40 ligand, 
nicotine, as a component in the vapor, seems to have a more compelling effect on 
extracellular vesicle formation and protein composition.

Nicotine lactate, nicotine tartrate, nicotine benzoate, and freebase nicotine 
(FBN) are four forms of nicotine salt systems that are present in tobacco 
products. However, few in vivo studies have compared their pharmacological (pK) 
efficacies, which are important for understanding their roles in the addiction 
and abuse of tobacco and nicotine products. In this work, the pK of the above 
nicotine salt systems was studied by subcutaneously injecting their aqueous 
solutions in rats and obtaining blood samples from the jugular vein. Nicotine 
levels in the blood were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. The results demonstrated that 
rapid nicotine absorption occurred in all nicotine systems. Of them, NB had the 
smallest Tmax , while FBN had the largest Tmax . The nicotine metabolic rate and 
clearance decreased for FBN, indicating that nicotine retention in the body was 
higher than for the other three salt-based systems. Compared with nicotine 
salts, FBN could reach and maintain a higher concentration in the animal model. 
Additionally, as the benzoic acid ratios increased, the Cmax of the nicotine 
benzoate (NB) in the plasma decreased. This indicates that the lower the pH, the 
lower the Cmax . When different concentrations of NB were used, the higher the 
NB concentration, the greater the Cmax and AUC(0-t) . These results demonstrate 
that nicotine adsorption by NB in the animal model depended on both pH and 
concentration. This baseline information could be used to explain different 
clinical pharmacological observations in humans, though this study only 
considered the effects of nicotine on pharmacokinetics in vivo.

IMPORTANCE: Transitions between e-cigarettes and cigarettes are common among 
tobacco users, but empirical evidence on the health outcomes of switching 
tobacco products is scarce.
OBJECTIVES: To examine changes in urinary biomarkers between baseline and 1-year 
follow-up among adult tobacco users switching between e-cigarettes and 
cigarettes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study used data from wave 1 
(baseline, September 2013 to December 2014) and wave 2 (1-year follow-up, 
October 2014 to October 2015) of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health 
Study. A subset of the probability sample of US adults who voluntarily provided 
biospecimens at 2 waves was analyzed. Participants were divided into 3 mutually 
exclusive groups at baseline: exclusive cigarette smokers, exclusive e-cigarette 
users, and dual users. Data analysis was performed in 2021.
EXPOSURES: Harmful and potentially harmful constituents included nicotine 
metabolites, tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs; including 
4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol [NNAL]), metals, polycyclic 
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Within-participant changes in 55 urinary biomarkers 
of exposure (BOEs) to harmful and potentially harmful constituents were examined 
using multivariable regression models.
RESULTS: Among 3211 participants (55.6% women, 68.3% White, 13.2% Black, and 
11.8% Hispanic) at baseline, 21.9% of exclusive cigarette users, 42.8% of 
exclusive e-cigarette users, and 62.1% of dual users changed product use at 
follow-up (all percentages are weighted). There was a significant reduction in 
urine concentrations of TSNAs, PAHs, and VOCs when users transitioned from 
exclusive cigarette to exclusive e-cigarette use, with a 92% decrease in NNAL, 
from a mean of 168.4 pg/mg creatinine (95% CI, 102.3-277.1 pg/mg creatinine) to 
12.9 pg/mg creatinine (95% CI, 6.4-25.7 pg/mg creatinine; P < .001). A similar 
panel of BOEs decreased when dual users transitioned to exclusive e-cigarette 
use; NNAL levels decreased by 96%, from a mean of 143.4 pg/mg creatinine (95% 
CI, 86.7-237.0 pg/mg creatinine) to 6.3 pg/mg creatinine (95% CI, 3.5-11.4 pg/mg 
creatinine; P < .001). Nicotine metabolites, TSNAs, PAHs, and VOCs significantly 
increased when baseline exclusive e-cigarette users transitioned to exclusive 
cigarette use or dual use. Switching from exclusive cigarette use to dual use 
was not associated with significant decreases in BOEs.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This national cohort study provides evidence on the 
potential harm reduction associated with transitioning from exclusive cigarette 
use or dual use to exclusive e-cigarette use. e-Cigarettes tend to supplement 
cigarettes through dual use instead of cessation at the population level. 
Continuous monitoring of BOE at the population level and assessment of BOE 
change by product transition are warranted, as well as defined adverse health 
outcomes.

Increasing use of non-combusted forms of nicotine such as e-cigarettes poses 
important public health questions regarding their specific risks relative to 
combusted tobacco products such as cigarettes. To fully delineate these risks, 
improved biomarkers that can distinguish between these forms of nicotine use are 
needed. Prior work has suggested that methylation status at cg05575921 may serve 
as a specific biomarker of combusted tobacco smoke exposure. We hypothesized 
combining this epigenetic biomarker with conventional metabolite assays could 
classify the type of nicotine product consumption. Therefore, we determined DNA 
methylation and serum cotinine values in samples from 112 smokers, 35 
e-cigarette users, 19 smokeless tobacco users, and 269 controls, and performed 
mass spectroscopy analyses of urine samples from all nicotine users and 22 
verified controls to determine urinary levels of putatively nicotine 
product-specific substances; propylene glycol, 2-cyanoethylmercapturic acid 
(CEMA), and anabasine. 1) Cigarette smoking was associated with a dose dependent 
demethylation of cg05575921 and increased urinary CEMA and anabasine levels, 2) 
e-cigarette use did not demethylate cg05575921, 3) smokeless tobacco use also 
did not demethylate cg05575921 but was positively associated with anabasine 
levels 4) CEMA and cg05575921 levels were highly correlated and 5) propylene 
glycol levels did not reliably distinguish use groups. Cg05575921 assessments 
distinguish exposure to tobacco smoke from smokeless sources of nicotine 
including e-cigarettes and smokeless tobacco, neither of which are associated 
with cg05575921 demethylation. A combination of methylomic and metabolite 
profiling may allow for accurate classification use status of a variety of 
nicotine containing products.

Maternal smoking during pregnancy is a significant risk factor of renal 
pathology in the offspring. E-cigarettes are perceived to be a safe option and 
are increasingly used by pregnant women either continuously during pregnancy or 
as a replacement for tobacco cigarettes. This study aimed to determine the 
effects of replacing tobacco cigarettes with e-cigarettes during pregnancy, and 
continuous e-cigarette use during pregnancy on the offspring's kidneys. Female 
Balb/c mice were exposed to either air (sham) or tobacco cigarette smoke (SE) 
for 6 weeks prior to mating, during gestation and lactation. A subset of the "SE 
group" received e-cigarette vapor (containing nicotine) after mating until pups 
weaned. Additional female mice were continuously exposed to e-vapor (either with 
or without nicotine) for 6 weeks prior to mating until pups weaned. Kidneys and 
urine from the male offspring were assessed at postnatal day 1, day 20 
(weaning), and 13 weeks of age (adulthood). E-cigarette replacement was less 
detrimental to renal development and albuminuria than continuous SE during 
pregnancy. However, continuous e-vapor exposure during pregnancy increased 
markers of oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis in the adult offspring, 
independent of nicotine. E-cigarette use during pregnancy confers future risk to 
the offspring's kidneys.

The use of e-cigarettes to deliver aerosolized nicotine has gained popularity in 
recent years. Numerous reports have cited the development of acute pulmonary 
disease linked to vaping nicotine as well as marijuana-based products. As 
cultural attitudes evolve and policies shift toward the legalization of 
marijuana, its use has become more prevalent. Given the increased prevalence of 
marijuana consumption and e-cigarette usage, better insight into its potential 
to cause lung toxicity is warranted. The clinical, radiographic, and 
histopathologic characteristics of lung injury associated with vaping, 
particularly with marijuana-based products, have yet to be well described in the 
literature. We present eight patients, most of whom were admitted recently to 
our institution with acute respiratory failure following vaping. The majority of 
patients were young, with a median age of 31.5 years (range, 24-62 years) and 
with no known underlying lung disease. This case series highlights common 
clinical findings as well as the varied radiographic and histopathologic 
features of acute respiratory failure associated with vaping predominantly 
marijuana-based products. As more cases of vaping-associated pulmonary injury 
unfold, data will be available to further characterize this emerging disease 
entity. Improved understanding of disease pathogenesis and its clinical course 
will help clinicians determine optimal management and follow-up strategies for 
this patient population.

BACKGROUND: Traditional hookah smoking has grown quickly to become a global 
tobacco epidemic. More recently, electronic hookahs (e-hookahs)-vaped through 
traditional water pipes-were introduced as healthier alternatives to combustible 
hookah. With combustible tobacco smoking, oxidative stress, inflammation, and 
vascular stiffness are key components in the development and progression of 
atherosclerosis. The comparable effects of hookah are unknown.
RESEARCH QUESTION: What is the differential acute effect of e-hookah vaping 
vs combustible hookah smoking on oxidation, inflammation, and arterial 
stiffness?
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In a randomized crossover design study, among a cohort 
of 17 healthy young adult chronic hookah smokers, we investigated the effect of 
e-hookah vaping and hookah smoking on measures of conduit arterial stiffness, 
including carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV), augmentation 
index-corrected for heart rate before and after a 30-min exposure session. We 
assessed a panel of circulating biomarkers indicative of inflammation and 
oxidants and measured plasma nicotine and exhaled carbon monoxide (CO) levels 
before and after the sessions.
RESULTS: e-Hookah vaping tended to lead to a larger acute increase in PWV than 
hookah smoking (mean ± SE: e-hookah, +0.74 ± 0.12 m/s; combustible hookah, +0.57 
± 0.14 m/s [P < .05 for both]), indicative of large artery stiffening. Compared 
with baseline, only e-hookah vaping induced an acute increase in augmentation 
index (e-hookah, +5.58 ± 1.54% [P = .004]; combustible hookah, +2.87 ± 
2.12% [P = not significant]). These vascular changes were accompanied by 
elevation of the proinflammatory biomarkers high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, 
fibrinogen, and tumor necrosis factor α after vaping (all P < .05). No changes 
in biomarkers of inflammation and oxidants were observed after smoking. Compared 
with baseline, exhaled CO levels were higher after smoking than after vaping 
(+36.81 ± 6.70 parts per million vs -0.38 ± 0.22 parts per million; P < .001), 
whereas plasma nicotine concentrations were comparable (+6.14 ± 1.03 ng/mL 
vs +5.24 ± 0.96 ng/mL; P = .478).
INTERPRETATION: Although advertised to be "safe," flavored e-hookah vaping 
exerts injurious effects on the vasculature that are, at least in part, mediated 
by inflammation.

BACKGROUND: The acute cardiovascular and pulmonary effects of contemporary 
electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) in long-term users are not known.
RESEARCH QUESTION: What are the cardiovascular and pulmonary responses to an 
acute 15-min product use challenge with ENDS and combustible cigarettes in 
regular nicotine-containing product users compared with control participants who 
do not use tobacco or vape?
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Observational challenge study before and after 
nicotine-containing product use of 395 individuals who used ENDS exclusively 
(n = 164; exhaled carbon monoxide level, < 5 parts per million [ppm]; positive 
urine NicCheck I [Mossman Associates] results, 82%; fourth-generation ENDS), 
participants who smoked cigarettes exclusively (n = 117; carbon monoxide level, 
> 5 ppm; positive urine NicCheck I results), and control participants (n = 114; 
carbon monoxide level, < 5 ppm; negative urine NicCheck I results).
RESULTS: During the 15-min product challenge, cigarette users took a median of 
14.0 puffs (interquartile range [IQR], 9.3 puffs); ENDS users took 9.0 puffs 
(IQR, 7.5 puffs; P < .001). After product challenge, compared with control 
participants, ENDS users showed greater increases in adjusted mean differences 
in systolic BP (5.6 mm Hg [95% CI, 4.4-6.8 mm Hg] vs 2.3 mm Hg [95% CI, 
0.8-3.8 mm Hg]; P = .001), diastolic BP (4.2 mm Hg [95% CI, 3.3-5.0 mm Hg] 
vs 2.0 mm Hg [95% CI, 1.1-3.0 mm Hg; P = .003), and heart rate (4.8 beats/min 
[95% CI, 4.0-5.6 beats/min] vs -1.3 beats/min [95% CI, -2.2 to -0.3 beats/min]; 
P < .001) and greater reductions in brachial artery diameter (-0.011 cm [95% CI, 
-0.013 to 0.009 cm] vs -0.006 cm [95% CI, -0.004 to -0.009 cm]; P = .003), 
time-domain heart rate variability (-7.2 ms [95% CI, -10.5 to -3.7 ms] vs 3.6 ms 
[95% CI, 1.6-9.3 ms]; P = .001), and FEV1 (ENDS: -4.1 [95% CI, -5.4 to -2.8] 
vs control participants: -1.1 [95% CI, -2.7 to 0.6]; P = .005) with values 
similar to those of cigarette users. ENDS users performed worse than control 
participants on all exercise parameters, notably metabolic equivalents (METs; 
adjusted mean difference, 1.28 METs [95% CI, 0.73-1.83 METs]; P < .001) and 60-s 
heart rate recovery (adjusted mean difference, 2.9 beats/min [95% CI, 0.7-5.0 
beats/min]; P = .008).
INTERPRETATION: ENDS users had acute worsening of blood pressure, heart rate, 
and heart rate variability, as well as vasoconstriction, impaired exercise 
tolerance, and increased airflow obstruction after vaping, compared to control 
participants.

DNA adducts are central in the mechanism of carcinogenesis by genotoxic agents. 
We compared levels of a DNA adduct of acrolein, a genotoxic carcinogen found in 
e-cigarette vapor, in oral cell DNA of e-cigarette users and non-users of any 
tobacco or nicotine product. e-Cigarette users and non-users visited our clinic 
once monthly for 6 months, and oral brushings and urine samples were collected. 
For this study, we analyzed oral cell DNA adducts from three monthly visits in 
e-cigarette users and non-users as confirmed by urinary cyanoethyl mercapturic 
acid and total nicotine equivalents. DNA was isolated from the oral brushings 
and analyzed by a validated liquid chromatography-nanoelectrospray 
ionization-high resolution tandem mass spectrometry method for the acrolein DNA 
adduct 
8R/S-3-(2'-deoxyribos-1'-yl)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-8-hydroxypyrimido[1,2-a]purine-10-(3H)-one 
(γ-OH-Acr-dGuo). The median value of this DNA adduct in the e-cigarette users 
was 179 fmol/µmol dGuo (range 5.0 - 793 fmol/µmol dGuo) while that for non-users 
was 21.0 fmol/µmol dGuo (range 5.0 - 539 fmol/µmol dGuo), P = 0.001. These 
results demonstrate for the first time that e-cigarette users have elevated 
levels of a carcinogen-DNA adduct in their oral cells.

CONTEXT: Use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) has rapidly increased 
despite unclear longitudinal health effects. Once thought to be a safer 
alternative to tobacco smoke, it is possible that e-cigarettes expose the user 
to similar carcinogenic byproducts during the vaping process. These toxicants 
are metabolized and excreted in the urine, and may have oncogenic implications 
for bladder urothelium.
OBJECTIVE: To characterize and summarize known urinary carcinogenic biomarkers 
in e-cigarette users as they relate to the risk of developing bladder cancer.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A systematic literature search was performed using the 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 
guidelines, and included PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central 
Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). Relevant articles published in 
peer-reviewed journals, through January 2019, that reported on urinary 
biomarkers in e-cigarettes users were included. Parent compounds and urinary 
biomarkers were classified according to the International Agency for Research on 
Cancer Monographs on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans and cross 
referenced using the Collaborative on Health and the Environment, Toxicant and 
Disease Database to determine a link to bladder cancer, grouped by strength of 
evidence.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Our initial search identified 1385 articles, 22 of which met 
final inclusion criteria and were included for analysis. In summation, these 
studies described 40 different parent compounds and four metals found in the 
urine of e-cigarette users. Since each parent compound can be metabolized 
several different ways, 63 unique toxicant or carcinogenic metabolite biomarkers 
were identified. Compared with nonuser controls, e-cigarette users had higher 
concentrations of urinary biomarkers of several carcinogenic compounds linked to 
bladder cancer. The majority of studies were limited by heterogeneous reporting 
and a dearth of control individuals who had never smoked.
CONCLUSIONS: Biomarkers of carcinogens, several with a strong link to bladder 
cancer, are present in the urine of e-cigarette users. Long-term implications of 
urothelial exposure to these toxicants are unknown but concerning, given the 
similarities to tobacco smoke and its established relationship with bladder 
cancer. Further study on the urological safety of e-cigarettes is necessary.
PATIENT SUMMARY: Our review shows that several carcinogens that have a known 
link to bladder cancer are present in the urine of electronic cigarette 
(e-cigarette) users. Further study on the urological safety of e-cigarettes is 
necessary.

(1) Background: Electronic cigarettes are gaining more popularity not only among 
cigarettes smokers. Firstly, e-cigarettes were perceived as less harmful than 
traditional cigarettes, however, nowadays, they are arousing more controversy. 
The aim of this study was to assess the impact of e-cigarette usage on selected 
physicochemical properties of saliva. (2) Methods: The study population included 
128 patients: 40 patients using e-cigarettes, 39 patients smoking traditional 
cigarettes, and 49 non-smoking patients (non-smokers). Laboratory tests involved 
verification of saliva values of pH and concentration of total protein, calcium, 
and phosphates. (3) Results: Among e-cigarette users, the value of pH was lower 
and the concentration of total protein, calcium, and phosphates was higher than 
in the group of non-smokers. Statistically significant differences were observed 
in relation to calcium. Among traditional cigarette smokers, the value of pH was 
lower, concentrations of total protein and phosphates were higher than in the 
group of non-smokers. Statistically significant differences were observed in 
relation to total protein. (4) Conclusions: Saliva of e-cigarette users presents 
changes in physicochemical composition in comparison to traditional cigarette 
smokers and non-smokers, however, statistically significant differences were 
observed only in calcium concentration. Further longitudinal studies on a larger 
study group should be conducted to assess the effect of observed changes in oral 
health.

RATIONALE: Current nicotine replacement products provide a much slower onset of 
nicotine delivery than cigarettes, and hence are only marginally effective at 
supplanting cigarette smoking. Therefore, more effective forms of nicotine 
replacement are needed.
OBJECTIVES: This initial investigation characterized the pharmacokinetic (PK) 
and subjective effects of a novel sublingual (SL) nicotine tablet designed to 
deliver nicotine more rapidly to the bloodstream of smokers.
METHODS: Study 1 (N = 6) characterized the pharmacokinetics of a 2 mg nicotine 
SL tablet in comparison to an FDA-approved, marketed 2 mg nicotine lozenge. 
Study 2 (N = 24) assessed subjective responses of smokers to a single use of a 
1 mg and 2 mg SL tablet.
RESULTS: Study 1 found that the time to maximum blood nicotine concentrations 
was significantly shorter for the SL tablet (14 min) than for the lozenge 
(82 min), and the initial rate of nicotine absorption was higher (0.4 ng/mL*min 
vs. 0.0 ng/mL*min), supporting the hypothesis that the SL tablet delivered 
nicotine more rapidly. Study 2 found that participants reported immediate relief 
of nicotine withdrawal symptoms after tablet administration, and craving 
reduction after the 2 mg tablet approached the degree reported for their usual 
brands of cigarettes (4.2 vs. 4.6 on a 7-point scale). Other subjective 
responses showed the tablet to be an appealing alternative to smoking.
CONCLUSIONS: The novel SL tablet studied shows promise as a nicotine 
substitution strategy for tobacco harm reduction and smoking cessation 
treatment. Additional studies are warranted to further investigate the potential 
of this new approach.

Rationale: Proteolysis is a key aspect of the lung's innate immune system. 
Proteases, including neutrophil elastase and MMPs (matrix metalloproteases), 
modulate cell signaling, inflammation, tissue remodeling, and leukocyte 
recruitment via cleavage of their target proteins. Excessive proteolysis occurs 
with chronic tobacco use and is causative for bronchiectasis and emphysema. The 
effect of e-cigarettes (vaping) on proteolysis is unknown. Objectives: We used 
protease levels as biomarkers of harm to determine the impact of vaping on the 
lung. Methods: We performed research bronchoscopies on healthy nonsmokers, 
cigarette smokers, and e-cigarette users (vapers), and determined protease 
levels in BAL. In parallel, we studied the effects of e-cigarette components on 
protease secretion in isolated human blood neutrophils and BAL-derived 
macrophages. We also analyzed the nicotine concentration in induced sputum and 
BAL. Measurements and Main Results: Neutrophil elastase, MMP-2, and MMP-9 
activities and protein levels were equally elevated in both vapers' and smokers' 
BAL relative to nonsmokers. In contrast, antiprotease levels were unchanged. We 
also found that exposure of isolated neutrophils and macrophages to nicotine 
elicited dose-dependent increases in protease release. After vaping, measurable 
levels of nicotine were detectable in sputum and BAL, which corresponded to the 
half-maximal effective concentration values for protease release seen in immune 
cells. Conclusions: We conclude that vaping induces nicotine-dependent protease 
release from resident pulmonary immune cells. Thus, chronic vaping disrupts the 
protease-antiprotease balance by increasing proteolysis in lung, which may place 
vapers at risk of developing chronic lung disease. These data indicate that 
vaping may not be safer than tobacco smoking.

Because little is known about the effects of individual flavorants in electronic 
cigarette (e-cig) fluids on human platelet aggregation, we tested for the direct 
effects of 15 common e-cig flavorants on adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced 
human platelet aggregation ex vivo. To better understand a potential mechanism 
of action of flavorants, we quantified 2 phases of aggregation. Human 
platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was obtained from whole blood of healthy volunteers 
and used in a platelet aggregometry assay. PRP was incubated with 1 of 15 
different flavorant compounds (e.g., benzyl alcohol, eugenol, citronellol, 
menthol, menthone, diacetyl, maltol, limonene, methylbutyric acid, isoamyl 
acetate, acetylpyridine, eucalyptol, 2,5-dimethylpyrazine, cinnamaldehyde, and 
vanillin) at 100 µM for 5 min at 37 °C prior to addition of ADP (10 µM). 
Subsequent ADP-induced platelet aggregation was tracked for 5 min using an 
aggregometer. Aggregation curves were analyzed for flavorant-induced effects on 
total (%) aggregation, Phase 1 and Phase 2 components, and compared with their 
ADP-only control via One-Way ANOVA. Notably, eugenol significantly inhibited 
total aggregation; an effect due solely to inhibition of Phase 2. No other 
flavor tested had any effect on total or phase-specific ADP-induced platelet 
aggregation. These results indicate that parent flavorant compounds commonly 
found in e-cig liquids neither activate nor inhibit ADP-induced human platelet 
aggregation. However, as flavorants are chemically altered during heating of 
e-cig, thermally-derived products of flavorants (e.g., flavor acetals) also will 
need to be tested for effects on platelet activation.

The formation of carbonyls and epoxides in e-cigarette (EC) aerosol is possible 
due to heating of the liquid constituents. However, high background levels of 
these compounds have inhibited a clear assessment of exposure during use of ECs. 
An EC containing an e-liquid replaced with 10% of 13C-labeled propylene glycol 
and glycerol was used in a controlled use clinical study with 20 EC users. In 
addition, five smokers smoked cigarettes spiked with the described e-liquid. 
Seven carbonyls (formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acrolein, acetone, crotonaldehyde, 
methacrolein, propionaldehyde) were measured in the aerosol and the mainstream 
smoke. Corresponding biomarkers of exposure were determined in the user's urine 
samples. 13C-labeled formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and acrolein were found in EC 
aerosol, while all seven labeled carbonyls were detected in smoke. The labeled 
biomarkers of exposure to formaldehyde (13C-thiazolidine carboxylic acid and 
13C-N-(1,3-thiazolidine-4-carbonyl)glycine), acrolein 
(13C3-3-hydroxypropylmercapturic acid) and glycidol 
(13C3-dihydroxypropylmercapturic acid) were present in the urine of vapers 
indicating an EC use-specific exposure to these toxicants. However, other 
sources than vaping contribute to a much higher extent by several orders of 
magnitude to the overall exposure of these toxicants. Comparing data for the 
native (unlabeled) and the labeled (exposure-specific) biomarkers revealed 
vaping as a minor source of user's exposure to these toxicants while other 
carbonyls and epoxides were not detectable in the EC aerosol.

BACKGROUND: Vaping continues to grow as an alternative to smoking and as a 
recreational activity for people of all ages, including minors. The 
billion-dollar industry offers users a plethora of flavors, nicotine 
concentrations, e-juice combinations, and devices. While some studies suggest 
vaping is beneficial for certain ailments and as a smoking cessation tool, many 
studies report concerning health outcomes associated with vape use. Recent FDA 
regulations have banned certain vaping products following an increase of 
vaping-related lung injuries reported in 2019. Health care providers need to 
better understand the physiological effects of vaping-specific products and the 
impact of secondhand vapor. The specific aims of the present study were to 
understand the immediate effects on heart rate, breathing frequency, blood 
pressure, blood sugar, [Formula: see text], pulmonary function, and oral 
temperature following e-cigarette use and secondhand vapor exposure.
METHODS: A total of 149 volunteers participated in this study; 76 subjects vaped 
mint-flavored e-cigarettes with 5% nicotine for 20 min while seated next to 73 
nonvaping subjects who agreed to be exposed to the vapor. Health variables 
including heart rate, blood pressure, breathing frequency, blood glucose, FVC, 
[Formula: see text], and oral temperature were obtained prior to vaping or 
exposure to vapor and again after 20 min.
RESULTS: Subjects who vaped had significantly higher heart rate, breathing 
frequency, and oral temperature, and significantly lower blood oxygenation 
levels (ie, [Formula: see text]) after vaping for 20 min. Nonvaping subjects 
exposed to vapor had significantly higher oral temperature after 20 min of 
exposure. Blood sugar and FVC were not significantly affected by vaping or 
exposure to vapor.
CONCLUSIONS: Vaping with mint-flavored e-cigarettes with 5% nicotine for 20 min 
resulted in significant immediate physiological changes. Exposure to e-cigarette 
vapor significantly increased oral temperature within the same amount of time.

Common E-Cigarette Flavoring Chemicals Impair Neutrophil Phagocytosis and 
Oxidative Burst.

Hickman E, Herrera CA, Jaspers I.

E-cigarette flavorings have not been thoroughly evaluated for inhalational 
toxicity. We have shown that the flavoring chemical cinnamaldehyde impairs human 
neutrophils, macrophages, and natural killer cells. Here we investigated the 
effects of other common e-liquid flavoring chemicals on phagocytosis and 
oxidative burst in neutrophils. We demonstrate that cinnamaldehyde and ethyl 
vanillin dose-dependently decrease oxidative burst and that benzaldehyde and 
benzaldehyde propylene glycol acetal dose-dependently impair phagocytosis. 
Isoamyl acetate did not affect either measure of neutrophil function. These data 
suggest that inhaling aromatic aldehydic flavoring chemicals, such as 
cinnamaldehyde, benzaldehyde, benzaldehyde propylene glycol acetal, or ethyl 
vanillin, could impair neutrophil function.

INTRODUCTION: Reduced-risk nicotine products are more likely to replace smoking 
if they match cigarettes in nicotine delivery and user satisfaction.
AIMS AND METHODS: We examined the nicotine delivery profile and user ratings of 
IQOS heated tobacco system and compared it with own brand cigarettes (OBC), 
Juul, and refillable e-cigarettes (EC).Participants (N = 22) who were daily 
vapers smoking <1 cigarette per day on average, attended after overnight 
abstinence from smoking and vaping, to test at separate sessions OBC, IQOS, and 
Juul. Eight participants also tested two refillable EC using e-liquid with 20 
mg/mL nicotine. At each session, a baseline blood sample was taken before 
participants used the product ad libitum for 5 minutes. Further samples were 
taken at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 30 minutes. Maximum nicotine concentration (Cmax), 
time to Cmax (Tmax), and nicotine delivered over 30 minutes (AUC0->30) were 
calculated. Participants rated their urge to smoke and product characteristics.
RESULTS: IQOS delivered less nicotine than OBC (AUC0->30: z = -2.73, p = .006), 
and than Juul (AUC0->30: z = -3.08, p = .002; Cmax: z = -2.65, p = .008), and 
received less favorable ratings than Juul (effect on urges to smoke: z = -3.23, 
p = .001; speed of urge relief: z = -2.75, p = .006; recommendation to friends: 
z = -2.45, p = .014). Compared with refillable EC, IQOS delivered nicotine 
faster (Tmax: z = -2.37, p = .018), but received less favorable overall ratings 
(recommended to friends: z = -2.32, p = .021).
CONCLUSIONS: IQOS' pharmacokinetic profile suggests that it may be less 
effective than Juul for smoking cessation, but at least as effective as 
refillable EC; although participants, who were experienced vapers rather than 
IQOS users, preferred refillable EC.
IMPLICATIONS: Because IQOS provided less efficient nicotine delivery than 
cigarettes and Juul in this sample, and also had a weaker effect on urges to 
smoke than Juul, it could be less helpful than Juul in assisting such dual 
users, and possibly smokers generally, to switch to an alternative product. 
IQOS, however, provided nicotine faster than refillable EC products, although 
participants preferred EC.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to examine differences between 
perceived harm of cigarette and electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use while 
pregnant and differences between healthcare providers' communication about these 
products during pregnancy.
METHODS: A convenience sample of gestational women (n = 218; ages 18-45) living 
in the US completed an online survey between May and December 2017. Participants 
reported perceived likelihood of adverse health outcomes (e.g., low birth 
weight, sudden infant death syndrome) among infants/children born to mothers who 
used cigarettes/e-cigarettes. T-tests and two-way ANOVAs examined differences 
between risk perceptions of using cigarettes/e-cigarettes while pregnant based 
on pregnancy status (previously pregnant, currently pregnant, future pregnant). 
Chi-square analyses examined differences between healthcare provider 
communication about cigarette/e-cigarette use during pregnancy.
RESULTS: Overall, participants believed adverse health outcomes were 
significantly more likely to be caused by maternal use of cigarettes than 
e-cigarettes. Participants who planned to be pregnant reported higher 
endorsement that smoking combustible cigarettes would cause a miscarriage 
(p < .05) or increased blood pressure (p < .05) for a child than currently 
pregnant participants. Participants reported healthcare providers asked about 
(p < .05), advised them not to use (p < .001), and talked to them about health 
effects of smoking combustible cigarettes while pregnant (p < .001) 
significantly more than e-cigarettes.
CONCLUSIONS FOR PRACTICE: Healthcare providers working with pregnant women 
should perform the 5As behavioral intervention method to provide pregnant women 
with tobacco cessation care. They should also discuss the absolute harm nicotine 
exposure (via cigarettes or e-cigarettes) can have on fetal health and 
development.

The use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigs) is increasing rapidly, but their 
effects on lung toxicity are largely unknown. Smoking is a well-established 
cause of lung cancer and respiratory disease, in part through inflammation. It 
is plausible that e-cig use might affect similar inflammatory pathways. E-cigs 
are used by some smokers as an aid for quitting or smoking reduction, and by 
never smokers (e.g., adolescents and young adults). The relative effects for 
impacting disease risk may differ for these groups. Cell culture and 
experimental animal data indicate that e-cigs have the potential for inducing 
inflammation, albeit much less than smoking. Human studies show that e-cig use 
in smokers is associated with substantial reductions in blood or urinary 
biomarkers of tobacco toxicants when completely switching and somewhat for dual 
use. However, the extent to which these biomarkers are surrogates for potential 
lung toxicity remains unclear. The FDA now has regulatory authority over e-cigs 
and can regulate product and e-liquid design features, such as nicotine content 
and delivery, voltage, e-liquid formulations, and flavors. All of these factors 
may impact pulmonary toxicity. This review summarizes current data on pulmonary 
inflammation related to both smoking and e-cig use, with a focus on human lung 
biomarkers. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 26(8); 1175-91. ©2017 AACR.

The detection of synthetic cannabinoid (SC) intoxication cases is challenging, 
even more when the involved SC identification is requested in a forensic 
context. This situation can be complicated by new modes of SC consumption, 
non-specific symptomatology, and analytical pitfalls. To illustrate these 
issues, we report the case of a 16-year-old man who presented symptoms evocating 
of a seizure disorder in the minutes following the use of a friend's 
e-cigarette. At admission in the emergency department, his electroencephalogram 
was interpreted as coherent with a recent seizure episode. 5F-ADB, a third 
generation SC, was detected in the e-liquid and in an early collected (H2 after 
the e-cigarette use) serum sample (0.50 µg/L), but not in urine samples (H18 and 
H38). One 5F-ADB metabolite, O-desmethyl-5F-ADB (M5), was detectable in urine up 
to at least 38 h after intoxication. Neither 5F-ADB nor its metabolites could be 
detected in victim's hair sampled 3 months after the intoxication. Although 
leading to a non-specific symptomatology, acute SC intoxication should be 
considered when the case history is related to e-cigarette or e-liquid use. 
Early biological samples are recommended, even if analytical screening can be 
positive for SC metabolites in urine sampled until 2 days after exposure. 
Accordingly, data from the literature and the present case underscore the 
relevance of adding both main 5F-ADB metabolites (M5 and 5-OH-pentyl-ADB) to 
mass spectrum databases used for toxicological screening in order to reduce the 
risk of false-negative results in intoxication cases involving 5F-ADB.

BACKGROUND: The impact of misinformation about vapes' relative harms compared 
with smoking may lead to increased tobacco-related burden of disease. To date, 
no systematic efforts have been made to chart interventions that mitigate 
vaping-related misinformation. We plan to conduct a scoping review that seeks to 
fill gaps in the current knowledge of interventions that mitigate vaping-related 
misinformation.
METHODS: A scoping review focusing on interventions that mitigate vaping-related 
misinformation will be conducted. We will search (no date restrictions) MEDLINE, 
Scopus, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science Core Collection, Global Health, 
ERIC, and Sociological Abstracts. Gray literature will be identified using 
Disaster Lit, Google Scholar, Open Science Framework, governmental websites, and 
preprint servers (e.g., EuropePMC, PsyArXiv, MedRxiv, JMIR Preprints). Study 
selection will conform to Joanna Briggs Institute Reviewers' Manual 2020 
Methodology for JBI Scoping Reviews. Only English language, original studies 
will be considered for inclusion. Two reviewers will independently screen all 
citations, full-text articles, and abstract data. A narrative summary of 
findings will be conducted. Data analysis will involve quantitative (e.g., 
frequencies) and qualitative (e.g., content and thematic analysis) methods. 
Where possible, a single effect size of exposure to the mitigation of 
vaping-related misinformation will be calculated per sample. Similarly, where 
possible, each study will be coded for moderating characteristics to find and 
account for systematic differences in the size of the effect or outcome that is 
being analyzed. Quality will be appraised with the study quality assessment 
tools utilized by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Findings will 
be subjected to several different publication bias tests: Egger's regression 
test, Begg and Mazumdar's ran correlation test, and generation of a funnel plot 
with effect sizes plotted against a corresponding standard error.
DISCUSSION: Original research is urgently needed to design interventions to 
mitigate vaping-related misinformation. The planned scoping review will help to 
address this gap.

Propylene glycol and glycerol are e-cigarette constituents that facilitate 
liquid vaporization and nicotine transport. As these small hydrophilic molecules 
quickly cross the lung epithelium, we hypothesized that short-term cessation of 
vaping in regular users would completely clear aerosol deposit from the lungs 
and reverse vaping-induced cardiorespiratory toxicity. We aimed to assess the 
acute effects of vaping and their reversibility on biological/clinical 
cardiorespiratory parameters [serum/urine pneumoproteins, hemodynamic 
parameters, lung-function test and diffusing capacities, transcutaneous gas 
tensions (primary outcome), and skin microcirculatory blood flow]. Regular 
e-cigarette users were enrolled in this randomized, investigator-blinded, 
three-period crossover study. The periods consisted of nicotine-vaping 
(nicotine-session), nicotine-free vaping (nicotine-free-session), and complete 
cessation of vaping (stop-session), all maintained for 5 days before the session 
began. Multiparametric metabolomic analyses were used to verify subjects' 
protocol compliance. Biological/clinical cardiorespiratory parameters were 
assessed at the beginning of each session (baseline) and after acute vaping 
exposure. Compared with the nicotine- and nicotine-free-sessions, a specific 
metabolomic signature characterized the stop-session. Baseline serum club cell 
protein-16 was higher during the stop-session than the other sessions (P < 
0.01), and heart rate was higher in the nicotine-session (P < 0.001). Compared 
with acute sham-vaping in the stop-session, acute nicotine-vaping 
(nicotine-session) and acute nicotine-free vaping (nicotine-free-session) 
slightly decreased skin oxygen tension (P < 0.05). In regular e-cigarette-users, 
short-term vaping cessation seemed to shift baseline urine metabolome and 
increased serum club cell protein-16 concentration, suggesting a decrease in 
lung inflammation. Additionally, acute vaping with and without nicotine 
decreased slightly transcutaneous oxygen tension, likely as a result of lung gas 
exchanges disturbances.

BACKGROUND: The blood-brain barrier (BBB) plays a critical role in protecting 
the central nervous system (CNS) from blood-borne agents and potentially harmful 
xenobiotics. Our group's previous data has shown that tobacco smoke (TS) and 
electronic cigarettes (EC) affect the BBB integrity, increase stroke incidence, 
and are considered a risk factor for multiple CNS disorders. Metformin was also 
found to abrogate the adverse effects of TS and EC.
METHODS: We used sucrose and mannitol as paracellular markers to quantitatively 
assess TS and EC's impact on the BBB in-vitro. Specifically, we used a 
quantitative platform to determine the harmful effects of smoking on the BBB and 
study the protective effect of metformin. Using a transwell system and 
iPSCs-derived BMECs, we assessed TS and EC's effect on sucrose and mannitol 
permeability with and without metformin pre-treatment at different time points. 
Concurrently, using immunofluorescence (IF) and Western blot (WB) techniques, we 
evaluated the expression and distribution of tight junction proteins, including 
ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-5.
RESULTS: Our data showed that TS and EC negatively affect sucrose and mannitol 
permeability starting after 6 h and up to 24 h. The loss of barrier integrity 
was associated with a reduction of TEER values. While the overall expression 
level of ZO-1 and occludin was not significantly downregulated, the distribution 
of ZO-1 was altered, and discontinuation patterns were evident through IF 
imaging. In contrast to occludin, claudin-5 expression was significantly 
decreased by TS and EC, as demonstrated by WB and IF data.
CONCLUSION: In agreement with previous studies, our data showed the metformin 
could counteract the negative impact of TS and EC on BBB integrity, thus 
suggesting the possibility of repurposing this drug to afford cerebrovascular 
protection.

Objectives: To develop and test a new system for whole body exposure of small 
animals to support investigation of the biological effects of aerosol generated 
by electronic cigarette (e-cig) products under diverse inhalation conditions 
with improved control and monitoring of the e-cig vape exposure and nicotine 
delivered to the animal's systemic circulation. Methods: A computer-controlled 
design, with built-in sensors for real time monitoring of O2, CO2, relative 
humidity, and temperature within the exposure chambers and port for measuring 
total particulate matter (TPM) was developed, constructed and tested. This 
design accommodates a variety of commercial vaping devices, offers software 
flexibility to adjust exposure protocols to mimic different users' puffing 
patterns, enables variable nicotine delivery to the animal's systemic 
circulation; minimizes travel time and alterations of aerosol quality or 
quantity by delivering aerosol directly to the exposure chamber, offers local or 
remote operation of up to six distinct exposure chambers from a single control 
unit, and can simultaneously test different exposure conditions or products in 
diverse animal groups, which reduces inter-run variability, saves time, and 
increases productivity. Results: The time course pattern of TPM concentration 
during different phases of the exposure cycle was measured. With increased 
puffing duration or number of exposure cycles, higher TPM exposure and plasma 
cotinine levels were observed with plasma cotinine levels in the range reported 
in light or heavy smokers. Conclusion: Overall, this novel, versatile, and 
durable exposure system facilitates high-throughput evaluation of the relative 
safety and potential toxicity of a variety of e-cig devices and liquids.

Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional antigen presenting cells that play a 
critical role in bridging innate and adaptive immunity. Numerous studies have 
shown that tobacco constituents present in conventional cigarettes affect the 
phenotype and function of DCs; however, no studies have examined the effects of 
vapour from E-cigarettes on human DCs. Here, the effects of E-cigarette vapour 
extract (ECVE) on the phenotype and function of DCs were investigated by 
creating an in vitro cell culture model using human monocyte-derived DCs 
(MoDCs). Immature DCs were generated from peripheral blood monocytes and mature 
DCs were then produced by treatment with LPS or Poly I:C for 24 h. For 
LPS-matured DCs, 3% ECVE treatment slightly suppressed HLA-DR and CD86 
expression, whereas 1% ECVE treatment enhanced IL-6 production. The overall 
expression of 29 signalling molecules and other cytoplasmic proteins (mainly 
associated with DC activation) was significantly upregulated in immature DCs by 
1% ECVE, and in LPS-treated DCs by 3% ECVE. In particular, the condition that 
induced IL-6 production also upregulated MAPK pathway activation. These findings 
indicate that E-cigarette vapour moderately affects human DCs, but the effects 
are less pronounced than those reported for tobacco smoke.

RATIONALE: Self-titration is well documented in the tobacco literature. The 
extent to which e-cigarette users (vapers) self-titrate is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: This study explored the effects of high and low nicotine strength 
liquid on puffing topography, nicotine delivery and subjective effects in 
experienced vapers.
METHODS: Eleven experienced male vapers completed 60 min of ad libitum vaping 
under low (6 mg/mL) and high (24 mg/mL) nicotine liquid conditions in two 
separate sessions. Measurements included puffing topography (puff number, puff 
duration, volume of liquid consumed) and changes in plasma nicotine levels, 
craving, withdrawal symptoms, self-reported hit, satisfaction and adverse 
effects.
RESULTS: Liquid consumption and puff number were higher and puff duration 
longer, in the low nicotine strength condition (all ps < 0.01). The mean 
difference in nicotine boost from baseline in the low condition was 
8.59 (7.52) ng/mL, 16.99 (11.72) ng/mL and 22.03 (16.19) ng/mL at 10, 30 and 
60 min, respectively. Corresponding values for the high condition were 
33.77 (34.88) ng/mL, 35.48 (28.31) ng/mL and 43.57 (34.78) ng/mL (ps < 0.05). 
There were no statistically significant differences between conditions in 
self-reported craving, withdrawal symptoms, satisfaction, hit or adverse 
effects.
CONCLUSIONS: Vapers engaged in compensatory puffing with lower nicotine strength 
liquid, doubling their consumption. Whilst compensatory puffing was sufficient 
to reduce craving and withdrawal discomfort, self-titration was incomplete with 
significantly higher plasma nicotine levels in the high condition.

Electronic cigarette use has especially risen among adolescents and young 
adults. The aim of this study was to investigate fasting blood glucose and lipid 
profiles in chronic combustible cigarette and electronic cigarette users. We 
evaluated participants aged 21 to 45 (n = 525, mean age 31 ± 7 years, 45% women) 
without established cardiovascular disease or risk factors who were combustible 
cigarette users (n = 290), electronic cigarette users (n = 131; 65 sole users 
and 66 dual users), or never users (n = 104). In the first wave of enrollment 
(2014-2017), electronic cigarette users reported their products as first, second 
and third generation devices (e-cig users) and were all largely current (i.e., 
dual) or former (sole) combustible cigarette users, whereas in the second wave 
of enrollment (2019-2020), electronic cigarette users all reported pod-based 
device use (pod users) and included more sole users who were never smokers. In 
multivariable-adjusted analyses comparing to never users, both sole e-cig users 
and combustible cigarette users had higher glucose and triglycerides and lower 
high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. Dual e-cig users showed 
higher triglycerides and very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and lower HDL 
cholesterol compared to never users. In contrast, pod users (both sole and dual) 
had lipid profiles and glucose levels similar to never users. Overall, users of 
early generation electronic cigarettes display adverse metabolic profiles. In 
contrast, pod-based electronic cigarette users have similar lipid profiles to 
never users. Future studies are needed to understand the cumulative effects of 
electronic cigarette use on cardiometabolic health.

BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtCN) maintains cellular function and 
homeostasis, and is linked to nuclear DNA methylation and gene expression. 
Increased mtCN in the blood is associated with smoking and respiratory disease, 
but has received little attention for target organ effects for smoking or 
electronic cigarette (EC) use.
METHODS: Bronchoscopy biospecimens from healthy EC users, smokers (SM), and 
never-smokers (NS) were assessed for associations of mtCN with mtDNA point 
mutations, immune responses, nuclear DNA methylation and gene expression using 
linear regression. Ingenuity pathway analysis was used for enriched pathways. 
GEO and TCGA respiratory disease datasets were used to explore the involvement 
of mtCN-associated signatures.
FINDINGS: mtCN was higher in SM than NS, but EC was not statistically different 
from either. Overall there was a negative association of mtCN with a point 
mutation in the D-loop but no difference within groups. Positive associations of 
mtCN with IL-2 and IL-4 were found in EC only. mtCN was significantly associated 
with 71,487 CpGs and 321 transcripts. 263 CpGs were correlated with nearby 
transcripts for genes enriched in the immune system. EC-specific 
mtCN-associated-CpGs and genes were differentially expressed in respiratory 
diseases compared to controls, including genes involved in cellular movement, 
inflammation, metabolism, and airway hyperresponsiveness.
INTERPRETATION: Smoking may elicit a lung toxic effect through mtCN. While the 
impact of EC is less clear, EC-specific associations of mtCN with nuclear 
biomarkers suggest exposure may not be harmless. Further research is needed to 
understand the role of smoking and EC-related mtCN on lung disease risks.

BACKGROUND: Electronic cigarettes (ECs) have been widely used by young 
individuals in the U.S. while being considered less harmful than conventional 
tobacco cigarettes. However, ECs have increasingly been regarded as a health 
risk, producing detrimental chemicals that may cause, combined with poor oral 
hygiene, substantial inflammation in gingival and subgingival sites. In this 
paper, we first report that EC smoking significantly increases the odds of 
gingival inflammation. Then, through mediation analysis, we seek to identify and 
explain the mechanism that underlies the relationship between EC smoking and 
gingival inflammation via the oral microbiome.
METHODS: We collected saliva and subgingival samples from 75 EC users and 75 
non-users between 18 and 34 years in age and profiled their microbial 
compositions via 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. We conducted raw sequence data 
processing, denoising and taxonomic annotations using QIIME2 based on the 
expanded human oral microbiome database (eHOMD). We then created functional 
annotations (i.e., KEGG pathways) using PICRUSt2.
RESULTS: We found significant increases in α-diversity for EC users and 
disparities in β-diversity between EC users and non-users. We also found 
significant disparities between EC users and non-users in the relative abundance 
of 36 microbial taxa in the saliva site and 71 microbial taxa in the subgingival 
site. Finally, we found that 1 microbial taxon in the saliva site and 18 
microbial taxa in the subgingival site significantly mediated the effects of EC 
smoking on gingival inflammation. The mediators on the genus level, for example, 
include Actinomyces, Rothia, Neisseria, and Enterococcus in the subgingival 
site. In addition, we report significant disparities between EC users and 
non-users in the relative abundance of 71 KEGG pathways in the subgingival site.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal that continued EC use can further increase 
microbial dysbiosis that may lead to periodontal disease. Our findings also 
suggest that continued surveillance for the effect of ECs on the oral microbiome 
and its transmission to oral diseases is needed.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Nicotine pouches (NPs) are a relatively new type of 
oral smokeless tobacco-free nicotine product. Currently, few data are available 
on the nicotine pharmacokinetics or subjective effects of NP use. The objective 
of this study was to determine and compare the pharmacokinetics of nicotine 
absorption into the blood from different NP variants and a combustible 
cigarette.
METHODS: In a randomised, controlled, crossover clinical study, nicotine 
pharmacokinetics and subjective effects were compared among commercially 
available NPs (five different brands; 6-10 mg nicotine/pouch) and a combustible 
cigarette. During an 8-day confinement period, 35 healthy adult participants who 
were current dual users of snus and combustible cigarettes used one study 
product each day for a defined period following overnight nicotine abstinence.
RESULTS: Nicotine maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the 
plasma concentration-time curve between 0 and 6 h (AUC0-6h) were significantly 
greater for the Lyft 10 mg NP than for the cigarette (both p < 0.0001), while 
the other NPs had Cmax and AUC0-6h values that were either greater than or 
similar to those of the cigarette. Plasma nicotine concentration was not 
associated with the nicotine contents of the NPs. Time to reach maximum plasma 
concentration (Tmax) was higher for all NPs (60-65 min) than for the cigarette 
(7 min). Regarding subjective effects, liking and intent to use product again 
scores were higher for the cigarette than for any NP and were lowest for the NP 
with the lowest nicotine content.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides important insight into nicotine 
pharmacokinetics and subjective effects during NP use, and demonstrates that NPs 
can provide nicotine in amounts sufficient to replicate cigarette smokers' 
nicotine uptake following a switch from conventional cigarettes to these 
potentially less harmful NP products. Further studies are required to ascertain 
how physical characteristics of NPs other than nicotine content may affect 
nicotine delivery, pharmacokinetics and subjective responses.

Innate immune cells of the respiratory tract are the first line of defense 
against pathogenic and environmental insults. Failure of these cells to perform 
their immune functions leaves the host susceptible to infection and may 
contribute to impaired resolution of inflammation. While combustible tobacco 
cigarettes have been shown to suppress respiratory immune cell function, the 
effects of flavored electronic cigarette liquids (e-liquids) and individual 
flavoring agents on respiratory immune cell responses are unknown. We 
investigated the effects of seven flavored nicotine-free e-liquids on primary 
human alveolar macrophages, neutrophils, and natural killer (NK) cells. Cells 
were challenged with a range of e-liquid dilutions and assayed for their 
functional responses to pathogenic stimuli. End points included phagocytic 
capacity (neutrophils and macrophages), neutrophil extracellular trap formation, 
proinflammatory cytokine production, and cell-mediated cytotoxic response (NK 
cells). E-liquids were then analyzed via mass spectrometry to identify 
individual flavoring components. Three cinnamaldehyde-containing e-liquids 
exhibited dose-dependent broadly immunosuppressive effects. Quantitative mass 
spectrometry was used to determine concentrations of cinnamaldehyde in each of 
the three e-liquids, and cells were subsequently challenged with a range of 
cinnamaldehyde concentrations. Cinnamaldehyde alone recapitulated the impaired 
function observed with e-liquid exposures, and cinnamaldehyde-induced 
suppression of macrophage phagocytosis was reversed by addition of the 
small-molecule reducing agent 1,4-dithiothreitol. We conclude that 
cinnamaldehyde has the potential to impair respiratory immune cell function, 
illustrating an immediate need for further toxicological evaluation of chemical 
flavoring agents to inform regulation governing their use in e-liquid 
formulations.

Under certain conditions, electronic cigarettes (e-cigs) can deliver nicotine to 
and suppress tobacco abstinence symptoms in cigarette smokers. Growing 
popularity of e-cigs raises abuse liability concerns. This study's purpose was 
to compare the abuse liability of an e-cig (1.5 Ohm, 3.3 V) filled with 36 mg/mL 
or 0 mg/mL nicotine to an Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved nicotine 
inhaler (IN) and participants' own brand (OB) of cigarettes. Smokers (N = 24) 
completed four sessions in which they completed the multiple-choice procedure, 
and plasma nicotine concentration and subjective effects were measured. Mean 
(SD) multiple-choice procedure crossover point was $0.87 (1.0) for the 36-mg/mL 
nicotine e-cig and $0.96 (1.2) for the 0-mg/mL e-cig, significantly higher than 
the IN mean of $0.32 (0.6) but significantly lower than the OB cigarette mean of 
$1.42 (1.4). Ten puffs from an own-brand cigarette increased mean plasma 
nicotine concentration from 3.55 (2.8) to 13.64 (9.8) ng/mL, as compared to an 
increase from 3.16 (1.8) to 8.51 (5.4) ng/mL for the 36-mg/mL e-cig. The 
36-mg/mL e-cig reduced nicotine abstinence symptoms more than the 0-mg/mL e-cig, 
and both e-cigs were rated as more reinforcing than the inhaler but less 
reinforcing than participants' OB cigarettes (ps < .05). Results suggest that 
the e-cig examined had higher abuse liability than the IN but lower than 
combustible cigarettes. These data and methods may be useful for policymakers by 
revealing how e-cig abuse liability compares to tobacco/nicotine products with 
abuse liability profiles that are well established. (PsycINFO Database Record

BACKGROUND: Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) have become popular, in part 
because they are perceived as a safer alternative to tobacco cigarettes. An 
increasing number of studies, however, have found toxic metals/metalloids in 
e-cigarette emissions.
OBJECTIVE: We summarized the evidence on metal/metalloid levels in e-cigarette 
liquid (e-liquid), aerosols, and biosamples of e-cigarette users across 
e-cigarette device systems to evaluate metal/metalloid exposure levels for 
e-cigarette users and the potential implications on health outcomes.
METHODS: We searched PubMed/TOXLINE, Embase®, and Web of Science for studies on 
metals/metalloids in e-liquid, e-cigarette aerosols, and biosamples of 
e-cigarette users. For metal/metalloid levels in e-liquid and aerosol samples, 
we collected the mean and standard deviation (SD) if these values were reported, 
derived mean and SD by using automated software to infer them if data were 
reported in a figure, or calculated the overall mean (mean ± SD) if data were 
reported only for separate groups. Metal/metalloid levels in e-liquids and 
aerosols were converted and reported in micrograms per kilogram and nanograms 
per puff, respectively, for easy comparison.
RESULTS: We identified 24 studies on metals/metalloids in e-liquid, e-cigarette 
aerosols, and human biosamples of e-cigarette users. Metal/metalloid levels, 
including aluminum, antimony, arsenic, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, copper, iron, 
lead, manganese, nickel, selenium, tin, and zinc, were present in e-cigarette 
samples in the studies reviewed. Twelve studies reported metal/metalloid levels 
in e-liquids (bottles, cartridges, open wick, and tank), 12 studies reported 
metal/metalloid levels in e-cigarette aerosols (from cig-a-like and tank 
devices), and 4 studies reported metal/metalloid levels in human biosamples 
(urine, saliva, serum, and blood) of e-cigarette users. Metal/metalloid levels 
showed substantial heterogeneity depending on sample type, source of e-liquid, 
and device type. Metal/metalloid levels in e-liquid from cartridges or tank/open 
wicks were higher than those from bottles, possibly due to coil contact. Most 
metal/metalloid levels found in biosamples of e-cigarette users were similar or 
higher than levels found in biosamples of conventional cigarette users, and even 
higher than those found in biosamples of cigar users.
CONCLUSION: E-cigarettes are a potential source of exposure to 
metals/metalloids. Differences in collection methods and puffing regimes likely 
contribute to the variability in metal/metalloid levels across studies, making 
comparison across studies difficult. Standardized protocols for the 
quantification of metal/metalloid levels from e-cigarette samples are needed.

OBJECTIVE: After the negative effects of smoking on public health were proven, 
smoking cessation campaigns were initiated by health ministries and 
non-governmental organizations. Many drugs have been tried to reduce the 
addiction to smoking and the nicotine contained in it. Recently, e-cigarettes 
(EC) are widely used for smoking cessation efforts, although the effects and 
possible harms are not fully known. In our study, we planned to show the effect 
of cigarette and EC smoke on the male urogenital system.
METHODS: Adult male wistar rats were exposed to cigarette and EC smoke in a 
specially designed glass bell jar. Urine cotinine levels, testicular weights, 
gonadosomatic index, sperm count and sperm motility, testicular histology, and 
biochemical findings were compared with the control group.
RESULTS: In some rats in the cigarette and EC group, the seminiferous tubules 
were disorganized, and the germ cells and Sertoli cells were separated and shed. 
Stopped germ cell separation, cavity formation, necrosis, fibrosis, and atrophy 
were observed in severe cases. Higher PCO levels were found in the cigarette 
group compared to controls. Tissue homogenates levels of LPO were higher in both 
EC and cigarette groups compared to controls. No significant differences were 
observed between groups in terms of sperm motility and sperm count.
CONCLUSION: Cigarette and EC liquid can increase oxidative stress as well as 
cause morphological changes in the testicle. To be a safe option in smoking 
cessation studies, its effect on people needs to be enlightened.

Many harmful constituents are present in e-cigarettes at much lower levels than 
in cigarette smoke, and the results of analysis of urinary biomarkers in 
e-cigarette users are consistent with these findings. However, understanding the 
health effects of chronic exposures to e-cigarette aerosols may require thinking 
beyond these comparisons. In this study, we investigated the endogenous 
formation of the tobacco-specific oral and esophageal carcinogen 
N'-nitrosonornicotine (NNN) in e-cigarette users. Salivary NNN, nornicotine, and 
nicotine as well as urinary tobacco biomarkers, including total NNN, were 
analyzed in 20 e-cigarette users, 20 smokers, and 19 nonsmokers. Nornicotine and 
NNN levels in e-cigarettes used by the study participants were also analyzed. 
The mean of NNN in saliva of e-cigarette users was 14.6 (±23.1) pg/mL, ranging 
from nonquantifiable (below the limit of quantitation, LOQ) to 76.0 pg/mL. In 
smokers, salivary NNN ranged from below LOQ to 739 pg/mL, with 80% of smokers 
having salivary NNN in the range of levels found in e-cigarette users. 
Consistent with a previous report, very low levels of urinary total NNN were 
present in only 5 out of 20 e-cigarette users (ranging from 0.001 to 0.01 
pmol/mL urine). Only trace levels of NNN were found in e-cigarette liquids. 
Together, our findings demonstrate that NNN is formed endogenously in 
e-cigarette users. While the overall exposure to NNN in e-cigarette users is 
dramatically lower than in smokers, the known carcinogenic potency of NNN 
warrants further investigations into the potential consequences of its 
endogenous formation. Salivary NNN, rather than urinary total NNN, which 
accounts for only 1-3% of the NNN dose, should be used to monitor e-cigarette 
users' exposure to this carcinogen.

BACKGROUND: Cigarette smoking and aging are the main risk factors for pulmonary 
diseases, including cancer. Epigenetic aging may explain the relationship 
between smoking, electronic cigarette vaping, and pulmonary health. No study has 
examined smoking and vaping-related epigenetic aging in relation to lung 
biomarkers.
METHODS: Lung epigenetic aging measured by DNA methylation (mAge) and its 
acceleration (mAA) was assessed in young (age 21-30) electronic cigarette vapers 
(EC, n = 14, including 3 never-smoking EC), smokers (SM, n = 16), and 
non-EC/non-SM (NS, n = 39). We investigated relationships of mAge estimates with 
chronological age (Horvath-mAge), lifespan/mortality (Grim-mAge), telomere 
length (TL-mAge), smoking/EC history, urinary biomarkers, lung cytokines, and 
transcriptome.
RESULTS: Compared to NS, EC and SM had significantly older Grim-mAge, shorter 
TL-mAge, significantly accelerated Grim-mAge and decelerated TL-mAge. Among SM, 
Grim-mAA was associated with nicotine intake and 
4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL). For EC, Horvath-mAA was 
significantly correlated with puffs per day. Overall, cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, 
and IL-8) and 759 transcripts (651 unique genes) were significantly associated 
with Grim-mAA. Grim-mAA-associated genes were highly enriched in immune-related 
pathways and genes that play a role in the morphology and structures of 
cells/tissues.
CONCLUSIONS: Faster lung mAge for SM is consistent with prior studies of blood. 
Faster lung mAge for EC compared to NS indicates possible adverse pulmonary 
effects of EC on biological aging. Our findings support further research, 
particularly on epigenetic markers, on effects of smoking and vaping on 
pulmonary health. Given that most EC are former smokers, further study is needed 
to understand unique effects of electronic cigarettes on biological aging.

IMPORTANCE: Use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) is increasing. Measures 
of exposure to known tobacco-related toxicants among e-cigarette users will 
inform potential health risks to individual product users.
OBJECTIVES: To estimate concentrations of tobacco-related toxicants among 
e-cigarette users and compare these biomarker concentrations with those observed 
in combustible cigarette users, dual users, and never tobacco users.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A population-based, longitudinal cohort study 
was conducted in the United States in 2013-2014. Cross-sectional analysis was 
performed between November 4, 2016, and October 5, 2017, of biomarkers of 
exposure to tobacco-related toxicants collected by the Population Assessment of 
Tobacco and Health Study. Participants included adults who provided a urine 
sample and data on tobacco use (N = 5105).
EXPOSURES: The primary exposure was tobacco use, including current exclusive 
e-cigarette users (n = 247), current exclusive cigarette smokers (n = 2411), and 
users of both products (dual users) (n = 792) compared with never tobacco users 
(n = 1655).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Geometric mean concentrations of 50 individual 
biomarkers from 5 major classes of tobacco product constituents were measured: 
nicotine, tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs), metals, polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbons (PAHs), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).
RESULTS: Of the 5105 participants, most were aged 35 to 54 years (weighted 
percentage, 38%; 95% CI, 35%-40%), women (60%; 95% CI, 59%-62%), and 
non-Hispanic white (61%; 95% CI, 58%-64%). Compared with exclusive e-cigarette 
users, never users had 19% to 81% significantly lower concentrations of 
biomarkers of exposure to nicotine, TSNAs, some metals (eg, cadmium and lead), 
and some VOCs (including acrylonitrile). Exclusive e-cigarette users showed 10% 
to 98% significantly lower concentrations of biomarkers of exposure, including 
TSNAs, PAHs, most VOCs, and nicotine, compared with exclusive cigarette smokers; 
concentrations were comparable for metals and 3 VOCs. Exclusive cigarette users 
showed 10% to 36% lower concentrations of several biomarkers than dual users. 
Frequency of cigarette use among dual users was positively correlated with 
nicotine and toxicant exposure.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Exclusive use of e-cigarettes appears to result in 
measurable exposure to known tobacco-related toxicants, generally at lower 
levels than cigarette smoking. Toxicant exposure is greatest among dual users, 
and frequency of combustible cigarette use is positively correlated with tobacco 
toxicant concentration. These findings provide evidence that using combusted 
tobacco cigarettes alone or in combination with e-cigarettes is associated with 
higher concentrations of potentially harmful tobacco constituents in comparison 
with using e-cigarettes alone.

OBJECTIVES: Vaping products continue to remain popular among teens and young 
adults despite an overall lack of research regarding their potential health 
effects. While much research focuses on respiratory effects associated with 
electronic cigarette use, their effects on other systems, including embryonic 
cardiovascular function and development due to maternal use during pregnancy, 
also needs to be evaluated. Here, we assessed the impact of nicotine-free, 
cinnamon and chocolate flavored, electronic cigarette vapor on cardiovascular 
function during early development by exposing wild-type zebrafish embryos to 
electronic cigarette vapor.
METHODS: Vapor was produced from a second-generation style vape pen and was 
incorporated into dechlorinated water at 0.6, 12, and 25 puffs/L, where one puff 
equals 55 ml of vapor. Vapor infused water was distributed among flasks to which 
zebrafish embryos were added. Exposures lasted for 24 hours and cardiovascular 
videos were recorded. Videos were analyzed and end systolic volume, end 
diastolic volume, stroke volume, heart rate, cardiac output, red blood cell 
density, and arterial and venous blood vessel diameters were measured.
RESULTS: Here, it was found that embryonic exposure to nicotine free, cinnamon, 
and not chocolate, flavored electronic cigarette vapor at 25 puffs/L 
significantly decreased all cardiovascular parameters measured, with the 
exception of blood vessel diameter. No significant effect on any measured 
parameter was observed at 0.6 or 12 puffs/L with either flavor.
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that cinnamon flavored electronic cigarette 
vapor can affect cardiovascular function during early development, even in the 
absence of nicotine, particularly at elevated exposure concentrations.

Electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use is increasing in Europe and the USA. 
While mounting evidence exists regarding an array of associated adverse health 
effects, to date limited evidence exists regarding the health effects of 
e-cigarette use on cardiovascular (CV) disease (CVD). The present review 
summarizes the effects of e-cigarette use on CV health. A search strategy of in 
vivo experimental, observational studies (including population-based cohort 
studies), and interventional studies was conducted in PubMed, MEDLINE, and Web 
of Science (April 1, 2009-April 1, 2022). The main findings revealed that the 
influence of e-cigarette on health are attributed mainly to the individual and 
interactive effects of flavors and additives used in e-cigarette fluids, along 
with the extended heating. The above collectively stimulate prolonged 
sympathoexcitatory CV autonomic effects, such as increased heart rate and 
diastolic blood pressure (BP), as well as decreased oxygen saturation. Hence, 
e-cigarette users are at increased risk of developing atherosclerosis, 
hypertension, arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, and heart failure. Such risks 
are anticipated to increase, especially among the young who are increasingly 
adopting e-cigarette use particularly with flavored additives. Further 
investigations are urgently needed to evaluate the long-term effects of 
e-cigarette use, particularly among susceptible population groups such as youth.

RATIONALE: Electronic (e)-cigarettes are popular among youth and cigarette 
smokers attempting to quit. Studies to date have focused on the utility of 
e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation tool, but the biological effects are largely 
unknown.
OBJECTIVES: To identify transcriptomic differences in the blood and sputum of 
e-cigarette users compared to conventional cigarettes smokers and healthy 
controls and describe biological pathways affected by these tobacco products.
METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of whole blood and sputum RNA-sequencing data 
from 8 smokers, 9 e-cigarette users (e-cigs) and 4 controls. Weighted gene 
co-network analysis (WGCNA) identified gene module associations. Ingenuity 
Pathway Analysis (IPA) identified canonical pathways associated with tobacco 
products.
MAIN RESULTS: In blood, a three-group comparison showed 16 differentially 
expressed genes (DEGs); pair-wise comparison showed 7 DEGs between e-cigs and 
controls, 35 DEGs between smokers and controls, and 13 DEGs between smokers and 
e-cigs. In sputum, 438 DEGs were in the three-group comparison. In pair-wise 
comparisons, there were 2 DEGs between e-cigs and controls, 270 DEGs between 
smokers and controls, and 468 DEGs between smokers and e-cigs. Only 2 genes in 
the smokers vs. control comparison overlapped between blood and sputum. Most 
gene modules identified through WGCNA associated with tobacco product exposures 
also were associated with cotinine and exhaled CO levels. IPA showed more 
canonical pathways altered by conventional cigarette smoking than by e-cigarette 
use.
CONCLUSION: Cigarette smoking and e-cigarette use led to transcriptomic changes 
in both blood and sputum. However, conventional cigarettes induced much stronger 
transcriptomic responses in both compartments.

Few studies have researched the gender-specific effects of electronic nicotine 
delivery systems on the metabolic syndrome (MetS) and/or its risk factors 
(central obesity, raised triglycerides, decreased HDL cholesterol, raised blood 
pressure, raised fasting plasma glucose). Thus, this study investigated the 
association between smoking behavior (cigarette type, smoking history) and MetS 
in a nationally representative sample of Korean men and women. Our study 
employed data for 5,462 cases of MetS and 12,194 controls from the Korea 
National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (KNHANES) for the years 2014 
to 2017. Logistic regression analysis was employed to determine the association 
between type of cigarette (non-smoker, ex-smoker, and current 
smoker-conventional only, current smoker-conventional and electronic) and the 
prevalence of metabolic syndrome and its risk factors. Smoking history was 
clinically quantified by pack-year. No association between cigarette type and 
MetS was found for men. For women, relative to non-smokers, smokers of 
conventional cigarettes (OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.02-3.18) and both conventional and 
electronic cigarettes (OR 4.02, 95% CI 1.48-10.93) had increased odds of MetS. 
While there was no association between smoking history and MetS for women, for 
men, conventional smoking history was associated with MetS for individuals with 
a smoking history of > 25 pack-years (> 25 to ≤ 37.5 OR 1.45, 95% CI 
1.04-2.02; > 37.5 to ≤ 50 OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.08-2.18; > 50 OR 1.56, 95% CI 
1.07-2.27). Sex differences were found in the association between smoking 
behavior and MetS. Such findings reveal sociodemographic differences that should 
be considered for interventions regarding conventional and/or e-cigarette users 
at risk of metabolic complications.

There is a paucity of data on how gene expression enables identification of 
individuals who are at risk of exposure to carcinogens from e-cigarette (e-cig) 
vaping; and how human vaping behaviors modify these exposures. This pilot study 
aimed to identify genes regulated from acute exposure to e-cig using RT-qPCR. 
Three subjects (2M and 1F) made three visits to the lab (nTOT = 9 visits); 
buccal and blood samples were collected before and immediately after scripted 
vaping 20 puffs (nTOT = 18 samples); vaping topography data were collected in 
each session. Subjects used their own e-cig containing 50:50 propylene glycol 
(PG):vegetable glycerine (VG) +3-6 mg/mL nicotine. The tumor suppressor TP53 was 
significantly upregulated in buccal samples. TP53 expression was puff volume and 
flow rate dependent in both tissues. In blood, the significant downregulation of 
N-methylpurine DNA glycosylase (MPG), a base excision repair gene, was 
consistent across all subjects. In addition to DNA repair pathway, cell cycle 
and cancer pathways were the most enriched pathways in buccal and blood samples, 
respectively. This pilot study demonstrates that vaping 20 puffs significantly 
alters expression of TP53 in human tissues; vaping behavior is an important 
modifier of this response. A larger study is needed to confirm these 
relationships.

RATIONALE: Electronic cigarettes are becoming increasingly popular among smokers 
worldwide. Commonly reported reasons for use include the following: to quit 
smoking, to avoid relapse, to reduce urge to smoke, or as a perceived lower-risk 
alternative to smoking. Few studies, however, have explored whether electronic 
cigarettes (e-cigarettes) deliver measurable levels of nicotine to the blood.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore in experienced users the effect of using 
an 18-mg/ml nicotine first-generation e-cigarette on blood nicotine, tobacco 
withdrawal symptoms, and urge to smoke.
METHODS: Fourteen regular e-cigarette users (three females), who are abstinent 
from smoking and e-cigarette use for 12 h, each completed a 2.5 h testing 
session. Blood was sampled, and questionnaires were completed (tobacco-related 
withdrawal symptoms, urge to smoke, positive and negative subjective effects) at 
four stages: baseline, 10 puffs, 60 min of ad lib use and a 60-min rest period.
RESULTS: Complete sets of blood were obtained from seven participants. Plasma 
nicotine concentration rose significantly from a mean of 0.74 ng/ml at baseline 
to 6.77 ng/ml 10 min after 10 puffs, reaching a mean maximum of 13.91 ng/ml by 
the end of the ad lib puffing period. Tobacco-related withdrawal symptoms and 
urge to smoke were significantly reduced; direct positive effects were strongly 
endorsed, and there was very low reporting of adverse effects.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate reliable blood nicotine delivery after 
the acute use of this brand/model of e-cigarette in a sample of regular users. 
Future studies might usefully quantify nicotine delivery in relation to 
inhalation technique and the relationship with successful smoking cessation/harm 
reduction.

INTRODUCTION: POD electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), often containing 
high concentrations of nicotine salts, have replaced MODs (ie, open/modifiable 
devices) as the most popular devices. The purpose of this study was to compare 
device/liquid characteristics, use behavior, and nicotine exposure between POD 
and MOD users.
METHODS: Data from the initial visit of a prospective observational study of 
exclusive ENDS users compared MOD (n = 48) and POD (n = 37) users. Participants 
completed questionnaires on demographic characteristics, patterns of ENDS use, 
and ENDS features. A urine sample was collected to test for cotinine and an ENDS 
liquid sample was collected to test for nicotine and salts. Puff topography was 
captured during an ad libitum bout at the end of the session.
RESULTS: MOD and POD users did not differ on demographic characteristics. MOD 
users reported purchasing more liquid in the past month than POD users 
(180.4 ± 28.0 vs. 50.9 ± 9.0 ml, p < .001). Differences in characteristics of 
devices used by MOD and POD users included flavor type (p = .029), nicotine 
concentration (liquids used by MOD users contained less nicotine than those used 
by POD users: 8.9 ± 2.0 vs. 41.6 ± 3.2 mg/ml, p < .001), and presence of the 
nicotine salt (fewer MOD liquids had salts present than POD liquids: 11.9% vs. 
77.4%, p < .001). User groups did not differ on urinary cotinine levels or puff 
topography (ps > .05).
CONCLUSIONS: Despite different characteristics of MOD and POD ENDS, users of 
those products are exposed to similar amounts of nicotine, likely due to using 
more liquid among MOD users.
IMPLICATIONS: This study directly compares ENDS product characteristics, user 
behavior, and nicotine exposure between MOD and POD ENDS users. Although POD 
products contained higher nicotine concentrations compared to MOD products, 
users of PODs reported consuming less liquid than MOD users. Ultimately, MOD and 
POD users were exposed to similar levels of nicotine, suggesting users 
behaviorally compensate for differences in product characteristics.

BACKGROUND: 4-(Methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL) is known as a 
lung carcinogen. The objective of this study was to investigate associations of 
urine NNAL concentrations and smoking status.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectionally designed study based on data from the 
2016-2018 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. A total of 
2,845 participants were classified into past-smoker, electronic cigarette 
(e-cigar) only, dual-user, and cigarette only smoker groups. All sampling and 
weight variables were stratified and analysis was conducted accounting for the 
complex sampling design. Analysis of covariance was used to compare the 
geometric mean of urine NNAL concentrations and log-transformed urine NNAL level 
among smoking status with weighted survey design. Post hoc paired comparisons 
with Bonferroni adjustment was performed according to smoking status.
RESULTS: The estimated geometric mean concentrations of urine NNAL were 1.974 ± 
0.091, 14.349 ± 5.218, 89.002 ± 11.444, and 117.597 ± 5.459 pg/mL in 
past-smoker, e-cigar only, dual-user, and cigarette only smoker groups, 
respectively. After fully adjusting, log-transformed urine NNAL level was 
significantly different among groups (P < 0.001). Compared with the past-smoker 
group, e-cigar only, dual-user, and cigarette only smoker groups showed 
significantly higher log-transformed urine NNAL concentrations in post hoc test 
(all P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: E-cigar only, dual-user, and cigarette only smoker groups showed 
significantly higher geometric mean concentrations of urine NNAL than the 
past-smoker group. Conventional cigarette, dual users, and e-cigar users can 
potentially show harmful health effects from NNAL.

This study examined the impact of four variables pertaining to the use of 
e-cigarettes (e-cigs) on cravings for tobacco cigarettes and for e-cigs after an 
overnight abstinence period. The four variables were the nicotine level, the 
sensorimotor component, the visual aspect, and the aroma of the e-cig. In an 
experimental study, 81 participants without prior vaping experience first got 
acquainted with using e-cigs in a one-week tryout period, after which they 
participated in a lab session assessing the effect of five minutes of vaping 
following an abstinence period of 12 h. A mixed-effects model clearly showed the 
importance of nicotine in craving reduction. However, also non-nicotine factors, 
in particular the sensorimotor component, were shown to contribute to craving 
reduction. Handling cues interacted with the level (presence/absence) of 
nicotine: it was only when the standard hand-to-mouth action cues were omitted 
that the craving reducing effects of nicotine were observed. Effects of aroma or 
visual cues were not observed, or weak and difficult to interpret, respectively.

BACKGROUND: An outbreak of E-cigarette or Vaping Product Use-Associated Lung 
Injury (EVALI) with significant morbidity and mortality was reported in 2019. 
While most patients with EVALI report vaping tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) oils 
contaminated with vitamin E acetate, a subset report only vaping with 
nicotine-containing electronic cigarettes (e-cigs). Whether or not e-cigs cause 
EVALI, the outbreak highlights the need for identifying long term health effects 
of e-cigs. EVALI pathology includes alveolar damage, pneumonitis and/or 
organizing pneumonia, often with lipid-laden macrophages (LLM). We assessed LLM 
in the lungs of healthy smokers, e-cig users, and never-smokers as a potential 
marker of e-cig toxicity and EVALI.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study using bronchoscopy was conducted in healthy 
smokers, e-cig users, and never-smokers (n = 64). LLM, inflammatory cell counts, 
and cytokines were determined in bronchial alveolar fluids (BAL). E-cig users 
included both never-smokers and former light smokers.
FINDINGS: High LLM was found in the lungs of almost all smokers and half of the 
e-cig users, but not those of never-smokers. LLM were not related to THC 
exposure or smoking history. LLM were significantly associated with inflammatory 
cytokines IL-4 and IL-10 in e-cig users, but not smoking-related cytokines.
INTERPRETATION: This is the first report of lung LLM comparing apparently 
healthy smokers, e-cig users, and never-smokers. LLM are not a specific marker 
for EVALI given the frequent positivity in smokers; whether LLMs are a marker of 
lung inflammation in some e-cig users requires further study.

BACKGROUND: Few studies have evaluated Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems 
(ENDS) in longitudinal studies, as a potential source of metals which may have 
carcinogenic, neurotoxic, and cardiotoxic effects. We evaluated metal body 
burden by ENDS use status in a longitudinal population-based national survey.
METHODS: We used the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study 
wave 1 (2013-2014), wave 2 (2014-2015), and wave 3 (2015-2016) adult data to 
assess urinary concentrations of seven metals among (1) ENDS only users who 
never used any nonelectronic tobacco products (n = 50), (2) ENDS only users who 
were former users of any nonelectronic tobacco products (n = 123) and (3) Never 
users (n = 1501) of any tobacco product.
RESULTS: Among ENDS only users who never used any nonelectronic tobacco products 
(n = 50), the geometric mean ratios (GMRs) of Cd and Pb were 1.25 (95%CI: 
1.09-1.42) and 1.19 (95%CI: 1.05-1.34), respectively, compared to never users 
after adjustment for PATH Study wave, age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, 
region, secondhand smoke at home and work, and cannabis and other substance use. 
After the same adjustment, the corresponding GMRs were 1.48 (95%CI: 1.32-1.67) 
and 1.43 (95%CI: 1.28-1.60) for ENDS only users who were former users of any 
nonelectronic tobacco products (n = 123). No difference was observed in urinary 
concentrations of other metals comparing ENDS users to never users of any 
tobacco product.
DISCUSSION: ENDS users show higher urinary levels of Cd and Pb, including 
lifetime exclusive ENDS users compared to never users of any tobacco product. 
These findings are limited by the small sample size and could be related to 
underreporting of past combustible tobacco use or other factors. Metals typical 
of ENDS such as nickel and chromium unfortunately are not available in PATH. 
Studies assessing metal exposure associated with long term lifetime exclusive 
ENDS use (≥5 years) with larger sample size are needed.

BACKGROUND: Electronic cigarettes (e-cigs) are widely used devices that were 
initially created to aid in smoking cessation. However, their acute 
physiological effects are unclear and there have been a number of E-cig and 
Vaping Acute Lung Injury (EVALI) events reported.
RESEARCH QUESTION: What are the immediate physiological effects (i.e. 
cardiovascular, respiratory or blood-based responses) of acute e-cig usage in 
humans?
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane and Scopus databases 
were searched for English or French peer-reviewed articles published until May 
20, 2021 and measuring at least one physiological parameter before and after 
using an e-cig. The study followed PRISMA guidelines and assessed article 
quality using the Downs and Black checklist. Independent extraction was 
conducted by two reviewers. Data were pooled using random-effect models. 
Sensitivity analysis and meta-regressions were performed to explore 
heterogeneity.
MAIN OUTCOMES: Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, augmentation 
index (AIx75), fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), and spirometry were the 
most frequently assessed parameters and were therefore chosen for meta-analyses.
RESULTS: Of 19823 articles screened, 45 articles were included for the 
qualitative synthesis, and 27 articles (919 patients) were included in 
meta-analyses. Acute use of nicotine e-cig was associated with increased heart 
rate(SMD = 0.71; 95%CI 0.46-0.95), systolic blood pressure (SMD = 0.38; 95%CI 
0.18-0.57), diastolic blood pressure (SMD = 0.52; 95%CI 0.33-0.70), and 
augmentation index AIx75 (SMD = 0.580; 95%CI 0.220-0.941), along with decreased 
FeNO (SMD = -0.26; 95%CI -0.49 to -0.04). E-cig exposure wasn't associated with 
significant changes in any spirometry measure.
INTERPRETATION: Acute use of nicotine e-cigs was associated with statistically 
significant cardiovascular and respiratory responses. These devices have a 
physiological impact that could be clinically relevant, especially in terms of 
cardiovascular morbidity. However, the direct consequences of long-term e-cig 
use needs to be further explored.

Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are vaporisers of liquids often containing 
nicotine. In the inhaled aerosol carcinogens, ultrafine and metal particles are 
detected usually in concentrations below those measured in tobacco smoke. 
Therefore, these products are expected to be less harmful. This has not yet been 
proven. The long-term safety of e-cigarettes is unknown. Short duration use 
leads to airway irritation and increased diastolic blood pressure. So far only 
two randomised controlled trials have investigated efficacy and safety of 
e-cigarettes for smoking cessation: No clear advantage was shown in comparison 
to smoking cessation medication. Due to insufficient evidence, e-cigarettes 
cannot be recommended for smoking cessation. Problematic are the lack of 
regulation and standardisation of e-cigarette products, which makes general 
conclusions impossible.

BACKGROUND: Research indicates that, over time, exclusive e-cigarette users 
(vapers) gradually reduce the nicotine concentration in their e-liquid and 
transition to more sophisticated devices. Alongside this, consumption of 
e-liquid increases and constant cotinine levels are maintained.
AIMS: We aimed to confirm these observations in 27 experienced vapers tested at 
baseline and 12 months later, by measuring nicotine absorption (via salivary 
levels of the nicotine metabolite cotinine; ng/mL), nicotine concentrations in 
e-liquid (mg/mL), volume of e-liquid consumed (mL per day), device types and 
flavours used, both at baseline and 12 months.
RESULTS: Vapers reduced both their nicotine concentrations in e-liquid over 
12 months (from 13.83 mg/mL at baseline to 9.91 at follow up) but significantly 
increased their e-liquid consumption (from 4.44 to 6.84 mL). No significant 
changes in salivary cotinine concentrations (370.88 ng/mL at baseline and 
415.78 ng/mL at follow up) were observed. There was an increase in sub-ohming 
(using an atomiser coil with resistance of <1 Ω with increased power) at 
12 months, and in the use of fruit flavoured e-liquids.
CONCLUSIONS: Our sample of experienced vapers reduced the concentration of 
nicotine in their e-liquid over time, but maintained their nicotine intake 
possibly through self-titration via more intensive puffing. Findings suggest 
there may be little benefit in reducing nicotine e-liquid concentration since 
this appears to result in higher e-liquid consumption which may incur both a 
financial and health cost. Gaining an understanding of underlying reasons for 
lowering e-liquid concentration would be a useful line of empirical enquiry.

Electronic cigarettes (E-cigs) generate nicotine containing aerosols for 
inhalation and have emerged as a popular tobacco product among adolescents and 
young adults, yet little is known about their health effects due to their 
relatively recent introduction. Few studies have assessed the long-term effects 
of inhaling E-cigarette smoke or vapor. Here, we show that two months of 
E-cigarette exposure causes suppression of bone marrow hematopoietic stem and 
progenitor cells (HSPCs). Specifically, the common myeloid progenitors and 
granulocyte-macrophage progenitors were decreased in E-cig exposed animals 
compared to air exposed mice. Competitive reconstitution in bone marrow 
transplants was not affected by two months of E-cig exposure. When air and E-cig 
exposed mice were challenged with an inflammatory stimulus using 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS), competitive fitness between the two groups was not 
significantly different. However, mice transplanted with bone marrow from 
E-cigarette plus LPS exposed mice had elevated monocytes in their peripheral 
blood at five months post-transplant indicating a myeloid bias similar to 
responses of aged hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) to an acute inflammatory 
challenge. We also investigated whether E-cigarette exposure enhances the 
selective advantage of hematopoietic cells with myeloid malignancy associated 
mutations. E-cigarette exposure for one month slightly increased JAK2V617F 
mutant cells in peripheral blood but did not have an impact on TET2-/- cells. 
Altogether, our findings reveal that chronic E-cigarette exposure for two months 
alters the bone marrow HSPC populations but does not affect HSC reconstitution 
in primary transplants.

BACKGROUND: Despite the increasing prevalence of vaping e-cigarettes among 
adolescents, there remains a lack of population-level assessments regarding the 
objective measurement of nicotine exposure.
METHODS: This study analyzed a nationally representative sample of adolescents 
aged 13 to 17 years from Wave 5 of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and 
Health Study conducted between 2018 and 2019. Urinary nicotine metabolites, 
including cotinine and trans-3'-hydroxycotinine (3-HC), were assessed among 
exclusive nonnicotine e-cigarette users (n = 56), exclusive nicotine e-cigarette 
users (n = 200), and nonusers (n = 1059). We further examined nicotine exposure 
by past 30-day vaping frequency (ie, occasional [1-5 days], intermittent [6-19 
days], and frequent [20+ days]) and flavor types among nicotine e-cigarette 
users. Multivariable linear regressions tested pairwise group effects, and 
biomarkers were normalized by the log transformation.
RESULTS: Compared with nonusers, both nonnicotine and nicotine e-cigarette users 
exhibited higher levels of cotinine and 3-HC. Nicotine e-cigarette users had 
mean cotinine concentrations (61.3; 95% confidence interval, 23.8-158.0, ng/mg 
creatinine) approximately 146 times higher (P < .0001) than nonusers (0.4; 
0.3-0.5), whereas nonnicotine users (4.9; 1.0-23.2) exhibited cotinine 
concentrations ∼12 times higher (P = .02). Among nicotine e-cigarette users, the 
levels of cotinine and 3-HC increased by vaping frequency, with cotinine 
increasing from 10.1 (2.5-40.1) among occasional users to 73.6 (31.8-170.6) 
among intermittent users and 949.1 (482.5-1866.9) among frequent users. Nicotine 
exposure was not significantly different by flavor type.
CONCLUSIONS: E-cigarette use poses health-related risks resulting from nicotine 
exposure among adolescents. Comprehensive regulations of e-cigarette products 
and marketing, vaping prevention, cessation, and public policies are needed to 
prevent youth from developing nicotine addiction.

INTRODUCTION: The Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study is a 
longitudinal cohort study on tobacco use behavior, attitudes and beliefs, and 
tobacco-related health outcomes, including biomarkers of tobacco exposure in the 
U.S. population. In this report we provide a summary of urinary nicotine 
metabolite measurements among adult users and non-users of tobacco from Wave 1 
(2013-2014) of the PATH Study.
METHODS: Total nicotine and its metabolites including cotinine, 
trans-3'-hydroxycotinine (HCTT), and other minor metabolites were measured in 
more than 11 500 adult participants by liquid chromatography tandem mass 
spectrometry methods. Weighted geometric means (GM) and least square means from 
statistical modeling were calculated for non-users and users of various tobacco 
products.
RESULTS: Among daily users, the highest GM concentrations of nicotine, cotinine 
and HCTT were found in exclusive smokeless tobacco users, and the lowest in 
exclusive e-cigarette users. Exclusive combustible product users had 
intermediate concentrations, similar to those found in users of multiple 
products (polyusers). Concentrations increased with age within the categories of 
tobacco users, and differences associated with gender, race/ethnicity and 
educational attainment were also noted among user categories. Recent (past 12 
months) former users had GM cotinine concentrations that were more than 
threefold greater than never users.
CONCLUSIONS: These urinary nicotine metabolite data provide quantification of 
nicotine exposure representative of the entire US adult population during 
2013-2014 and may serve as a reference for similar analyses in future 
measurements within this study.
IMPLICATIONS: Nicotine and its metabolites in urine provide perhaps the most 
fundamental biomarkers of recent nicotine exposure. This report, based on Wave 1 
of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study, provides the 
first nationally representative data describing urinary nicotine biomarker 
concentrations in both non-users, and users of a variety of tobacco products 
including combustible, e-cigarette and smokeless products. These data provide a 
urinary biomarker concentration snapshot in time for the entire US population 
during 2013-2014, and will provide a basis for comparison with future results 
from continuing, periodic evaluations in the PATH Study.

Tobacco smoke (TS) is the leading cause of preventable deaths worldwide. In 
addition to a host of well characterized diseases including chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease, oral and peripheral cancers and cardiovascular complications, 
epidemiological evidence suggests that chronic smokers are at equal risk to 
develop neurological and neurovascular complications such as multiple sclerosis, 
Alzheimer's disease, stroke, vascular dementia and small vessel ischemic disease 
(SVID). Unfortunately, few direct neurotoxicology studies of tobacco smoking and 
its pathogenic pathways have been produced so far. A major link between TS and 
CNS disorders is the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In this review article, we 
summarize the current understanding of the toxicological impact of TS on BBB 
physiology and function and major compensatory mechanisms such as nrf2- ARE 
signaling and anti-inflammatory pathways activated by TS. In the same context, 
we discuss the controversial role of antioxidant supplementation as a 
prophylactic and/or therapeutic approach in delaying or decreasing the disease 
complications in smokers. Further, we cover a number of toxicological studies 
associated with "reduced exposure" cigarette products including electronic 
cigarettes. Finally, we provide insights on possible avenues for future research 
including mechanistic studies using direct inhalation rodent models.

BACKGROUND: The use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigs) is increasing and there is 
widespread perception that e-cigs are safe. E-cigs contain harmful chemicals; 
more research is needed to evaluate the safety of e-cig use. Our aim was to 
investigate the effects of e-cigs on the inflammatory response of human 
neutrophils.
METHODS: Neutrophils were exposed to e-cig vapour extract (ECVE) and the 
expression of CD11b and CD66b was measured by flow cytometry and MMP-9 and CXCL8 
by ELISA. We also measured the activity of neutrophil elastase (NE) and MMP-9, 
along with the activation of inflammatory signalling pathways. Finally we 
analysed the biochemical composition of ECVE by ultra-high performance liquid 
chromatography mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: ECVE caused an increase in the expression of CD11b and CD66b, and 
increased the release of MMP-9 and CXCL8. Furthermore, there was an increase in 
NE and MMP-9 activity and an increase in p38 MAPK activation. We also identified 
several harmful chemicals in ECVE, including known carcinogens.
CONCLUSIONS: ECVE causes a pro-inflammatory response from human neutrophils. 
This raises concerns over the safety of e-cig use.

INTRODUCTION: Electronic cigarettes (ECs) seem to be a less harmful alternative 
for conventional cigarettes. This study aimed to assess whether the generated 
aerosols from ECs contain lower amount of cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) than 
cigarette smoke and to detect any changes in exposure to Cd and Pb among 
cigarette smokers who switched completely or partially to EC.
METHODS: EC aerosols and cigarette smoke were generated, and the determination 
of Cd and Pb in trapped samples and e-liquids was performed by the 
electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry method. A cross-sectional, 
group-based survey was carried out using 156 volunteers classified into groups 
of nonsmokers, EC-only users, dual EC users-cigarette smokers, and 
cigarette-only smokers. Using electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry, 
blood Cd and Pb levels were measured, and the results were compared by analysis 
of covariance.
RESULTS: Transfer of Cd and Pb to EC aerosol was found to be minimal, although 
the metals were present in the remaining e-liquid from tanks used for vapor 
generation. The geometric mean blood Cd concentration adjusted for age and sex 
was 0.44 (95% confidence interval = 0.37 to 0.52) µg/L in the EC-only users, 
which was significantly lower than those in the smokers of 1.44 (1.16 to 1.78) 
and dual users of 1.38 (1.11 to 1.72). The blood Pb geometric mean differed 
significantly only between nonsmokers of 11.9 (10.6 to 13.3) and smokers of 15.9 
(13.6 to 18.6).
CONCLUSION: The study revealed that smokers who completely switched to ECs and 
quit smoking conventional cigarettes may significantly reduce their exposure to 
Cd and probably Pb.
IMPLICATIONS: Switching to EC use is associated with a rapid and substantial 
decrease in the exposure to carcinogenic Cd. Exposure to Pb is probably also 
decreased but may be overshadowed by other factors. The study provides empirical 
data based not only on the analysis of generated aerosol but also on biological 
indicators of recent exposure-that is, the concentrations of Cd and Pb in blood, 
indicating EC as a potential harm-reduction device, especially regarding Cd 
exposure. However, in this case, dual EC use-cigarette smoking provides doubtful 
benefits.

Data on the effectiveness of strategies for the recruitment of American Indians 
(AIs) into research is needed. This study describes and compares methods for 
identifying and recruiting AI tobacco users into a pilot study. Community-based 
strategies were used to recruit smokers (n = 35), e-cigarette users (n = 28), 
and dual users (n = 32) of AI descent. Recruitment was considered proactive if 
study staff contacted the individual at a pow wow, health fair, or vape shop and 
participation on-site or reactive if the individual contacted the study staff 
and participation occurred later. Screened, eligible, participated and costs and 
time spent were compared with Chi square tests. To understand AI descent, the 
relationship between number of AI grandparents and AI blood quantum was 
examined. Number of participants screened via the proactive strategy was similar 
to the reactive strategy (n = 84 vs. n = 82; p-value = 0.8766). A significantly 
greater proportion of individuals screened via the proactive than the reactive 
strategy were eligible (77 vs. 50%; p-value = 0.0002) and participated (75 vs. 
39%; p-value = < 0.0001). Per participant cost and time estimated for the 
proactive strategy was $89 and 87 min compared to $79 and 56 min for the 
reactive strategy. Proportion at least half AI blood quantum was 32, 33, and 70% 
among those with 2, 3, and 4 AI grandparents, respectively (p = 0.0017). 
Proactive strategies resulted in two-thirds of the sample, but required more 
resources than reactive strategies. Overall, we found both strategies were 
feasible and resulted in the ability to reach sample goals. Lastly, number of AI 
biological grandparents may be a good, non-invasive indicator of AI blood 
quantum.

RATIONALE: Non-contingent chronic nicotine exposure procedures have evolved 
rapidly in recent years, culminating in electronic nicotine delivery systems 
(ENDS or e-cigarettes) to deliver vaporized drugs to rodents in standard housing 
chambers.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of the current work was to use ENDS to test 
concentration-dependent effects of nicotine e-cigarette vapor inhalation on 
blood-nicotine concentrations, blood-cotinine concentrations, and somatic 
withdrawal signs over time in rats.
METHODS: Male Wistar rats were exposed to vapor containing various 
concentrations of nicotine (20, 40, 80 mg/mL) for 11 days through ENDS, and 
blood concentrations of nicotine and cotinine, the major proximate metabolite of 
nicotine, as well as spontaneous and precipitated somatic withdrawal signs, were 
measured over time (across days of exposure and over hours after termination of 
vapor exposure).
RESULTS: Exposing male Wistar rats to non-contingent nicotine vapor inhalation 
through ENDS produces somatic withdrawal symptoms and measurable blood-nicotine 
and blood-cotinine levels that change according to (1) concentration of nicotine 
in vape solution, (2) number of days of nicotine vapor exposure, (3) time since 
termination of nicotine vapor exposure, and (4) relative to the withdrawal 
signs, whether withdrawal was spontaneous or precipitated (by mecamylamine).
CONCLUSIONS: The data presented here provide parameters that can be used as a 
reasonable starting point for future work that employs ENDS to deliver 
non-contingent nicotine vapor in rats, although many parameters can and should 
be altered to match the specific goals of future work.

The debate about electronic cigarettes is dividing healthcare professionals, 
policymakers, manufacturers, and communities. A key limitation in our 
understanding of the cause and consequences of vaping is the lack of animal 
models of nicotine vapor self-administration. Here, we developed a novel model 
of voluntary electronic cigarette use in rats using operant behavior. We found 
that rats voluntarily exposed themselves to nicotine vapor to the point of 
reaching blood nicotine levels that are similar to humans. The level of 
responding on the active (nicotine) lever was similar to the inactive (air) 
lever and lower than the active lever that was associated with vehicle 
(polypropylene glycol/glycerol) vapor, suggesting low positive reinforcing 
effects and low nicotine vapor discrimination. Lever pressing behavior with 
nicotine vapor was pharmacologically prevented by the α4β2 nicotinic 
acetylcholine receptor partial agonist and α7 receptor full agonist varenicline 
in rats that self-administered nicotine but not vehicle vapor. Moreover, 3 weeks 
of daily (1 h) nicotine vapor self-administration produced addiction-like 
behaviors, including somatic signs of withdrawal, allodynia, anxiety-like 
behavior, and relapse-like behavior after 3 weeks of abstinence. Finally, 3 
weeks of daily (1 h) nicotine vapor self-administration produced cardiopulmonary 
abnormalities and changes in α4, α3, and β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor 
subunit mRNA levels in the nucleus accumbens and medial prefrontal cortex. These 
findings validate a novel animal model of nicotine vapor self-administration in 
rodents with relevance to electronic cigarette use in humans and highlight the 
potential addictive properties and harmful effects of chronic nicotine vapor 
self-administration.

OBJECTIVE: Electronic cigarette (e-cig) use has recently been implicated in 
promoting atherosclerosis. In this study, we aimed to investigate the mechanism 
of e-cig exposure accelerated atherosclerotic lesion development. Approach and 
Results: Eight-week-old ApoE-/- mice fed normal laboratory diet were exposed to 
e-cig vapor (ECV) for 2 hours/day, 5 days/week for 16 weeks. We found that ECV 
exposure significantly induced atherosclerotic lesions as examined by Oil Red O 
staining and greatly upregulated TLR9 (toll-like receptor 9) expression in 
classical monocytes and in the atherosclerotic plaques, which the latter was 
corroborated by enhanced TLR9 expression in human femoral artery atherosclerotic 
plaques from e-cig smokers. Intriguingly, we found a significant increase of 
oxidative mitochondria DNA lesion in the plasma of ECV-exposed mice. 
Administration of TLR9 antagonist before ECV exposure not only alleviated 
atherosclerosis and the upregulation of TLR9 in plaques but also attenuated the 
increase of plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines, reduced the plaque 
accumulation of lipid and macrophages, and decreased the frequency of blood 
CCR2+ (C-C chemokine receptor type 2) classical monocytes. Surprisingly, we 
found that cytoplasmic mitochondrial DNA isolated from ECV extract-treated 
macrophages can enhance TLR9 activation in reporter cells and the induction of 
inflammatory cytokine could be suppressed by TLR9 inhibitor in macrophages.
CONCLUSIONS: E-cig increases level of damaged mitochondrial DNA in circulating 
blood and induces the expression of TLR9, which elevate the expression of 
proinflammatory cytokines in monocyte/macrophage and consequently lead to 
atherosclerosis. Our results raise the possibility that intervention of TLR9 
activation is a potential pharmacological target of ECV-related inflammation and 
cardiovascular diseases.

BACKGROUND: Contemporary data on the prevalence of e-cigarette use in the United 
States are limited.
OBJECTIVE: To report the prevalence and distribution of current e-cigarette use 
among U.S. adults in 2016.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional.
SETTING: Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 2016.
PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged 18 years and older.
MEASUREMENTS: Prevalence of current e-cigarette use by sociodemographic groups, 
comorbid medical conditions, and states of residence.
RESULTS: Of participants with information on e-cigarette use (n = 466 842), 
15 240 were current e-cigarette users, representing a prevalence of 4.5%, which 
corresponds to 10.8 million adult e-cigarette users in the United States. Of the 
e-cigarette users, 15% were never-cigarette smokers. The prevalence of current 
e-cigarette use was highest among persons aged 18 to 24 years (9.2% [95% CI, 
8.6% to 9.8%]), translating to approximately 2.8 million users in this age 
range. More than half the current e-cigarette users (51.2%) were younger than 35 
years. In addition, the age-standardized prevalence of e-cigarette use was high 
among men; lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) persons; current 
combustible cigarette smokers; and those with chronic health conditions. The 
prevalence of e-cigarette use varied widely among states, with estimates ranging 
from 3.1% (CI, 2.3% to 4.1%) in South Dakota to 7.0% (CI, 6.0% to 8.2%) in 
Oklahoma.
LIMITATION: Data were self-reported, and no biochemical confirmation of tobacco 
use was available.
CONCLUSION: E-cigarette use is common, especially in younger adults, LGBT 
persons, current cigarette smokers, and persons with comorbid conditions. The 
prevalence of use differs across states. These contemporary estimates may inform 
researchers, health care policymakers, and tobacco regulators about demographic 
and geographic distributions of e-cigarette use.

BACKGROUND: There is considerable debate about the benefits and risks of 
electronic cigarettes (ECs). To better understand the risk-benefit ratio of ECs, 
more information is needed about net nicotine consumption and toxicant exposure 
of cigarette smokers switching to ECs.
METHODS: Forty cigarette smokers (≥1 year of smoking) interested in switching to 
ECs but not necessarily quitting smoking were enrolled in a 4-week observational 
study and provided an e-Go C non-variable battery and refillable atomizers and 
choice of eight flavors in 12 or 24 mg nicotine dosage. Measurement of urinary 
cotinine (metabolite of nicotine), 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol 
(NNAL; a pulmonary carcinogen), and eight volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that 
are toxic tobacco smoke constituents was conducted at baseline and week 4.
RESULTS: All participants with follow-up data (92.5%) reported using the study 
EC. Of the 40 smokers, 16 reported no cigarettes at week 2 (40%) and six 
continued to report no cigarettes at week 4 (15%). Change in nicotine intake 
over the 4 weeks was non-significant (p = .90). Carbon monoxide (p < .001), NNAL 
(p < .01) and metabolites of benzene (p < .01) and acrylonitrile (p = .001) were 
significantly decreased in the study sample. Smokers switching exclusively to 
ECs for at least half of the study period demonstrated significant reductions in 
metabolites of ethylene oxide (p = .03) and acrylamide (p < .01).
CONCLUSION: Smokers using ECs over 4 weeks maintained cotinine levels and 
experienced significant reductions in carbon monoxide, NNAL, and two out of 
eight measured VOC metabolites. Those who switched exclusively to ECs for at 
least half of the study period significantly reduced two additional VOCs.
IMPLICATIONS: This study extends current literature by measuring change in 
smoking dependence and disease-associated biomarkers, NNAL and a panel of eight 
common VOCs that are toxic tobacco smoke constituents in smokers who switch to 
ECs. The findings support the idea of harm reduction, however some levels of 
toxicant exposure are still of clinical concern, particularly for dual users. 
Extrapolation of these results must be careful to separate the different toxic 
exposure results for exclusive switchers versus dual cigarette + EC users, and 
not to equate harm reduction with the idea that using ECs is harmless.

BACKGROUND: Exposure of toxic metals from e-cigarette use is a cause for public 
health concern because youth, young adults, and non-smokers are the target 
population rapidly adopting e-cigarette use. The purpose of this research is to 
determine the association of the body burden of heavy metals with e-cigarette 
use using NHANES (U.S.) 2015-2016 data.
METHODS: Blood lead (N = 1899) and urinary cadmium, barium, and antimony 
(N = 1302) data were extracted from NHANES, 2015-2016; geometric means were 
calculated and bivariate and multivariable linear regression analyses were 
conducted. Participants were categorized as having neither e-cigarette nor 
cigarette use; smoking history (including dual use with e-cigarettes); and only 
e-cigarette (current or former).
RESULTS: In multivariable analyses adjusted for sex, race/ethnicity, age, and 
poverty levels, current or former e-cigarette use failed to reach a statistical 
significance in the association with metals. However, participants with a 
smoking history were more likely to have higher blood lead and urinary cadmium 
than participants who neither used e-cigarettes nor cigarettes.
CONCLUSION: Blood lead levels, and urinary cadmium, barium, and antimony levels 
were similar between participants who used e-cigarettes and participants who did 
not.

Electronic cigarette (e-cig) vaping (ECV) has been proposed as a safer 
alternative to tobacco cigarette smoking (TCS); however, this remains 
controversial due to a lack of long-term comparative studies. Therefore, we 
developed a chronic mouse exposure model that mimics human vaping and allows 
comparison with TCS. Longitudinal studies were performed to evaluate alterations 
in cardiovascular function with TCS and ECV exposure durations of up to 60 wk. 
For ECV, e-cig liquid with box-mod were used and for TCS, 3R4F-cigarettes. 
C57/BL6 male mice were exposed 2 h/day, 5 days/wk to TCS, ECV, or air control. 
The role of vape nicotine levels was evaluated using e-cig-liquids with 0, 6, or 
24 mg/mL nicotine. Following 16-wk exposure, increased constriction to 
phenylephrine and impaired endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent 
vasodilation were observed in aortic segents, paralleling the onset of systemic 
hypertension, with elevations in systemic vascular resistance. Following 32 wk, 
TCS and ECV induced cardiac hypertrophy. All of these abnormalities further 
increased out to 60 wk of exposure, with elevated heart weight and aortic 
thickness along with increased superoxide production in vessels and cardiac 
tissues of both ECV and TCS mice. While ECV-induced abnormalities were seen in 
the absence of nicotine, these occurred earlier and were more severe with higher 
nicotine exposure. Thus, long-term vaping of e-cig can induce cardiovascular 
disease similar to TCS, and the severity of this toxicity increases with 
exposure duration and vape nicotine content.NEW & NOTEWORTHY A chronic mouse 
exposure model that mimics human e-cigarette vaping and allows comparison with 
tobacco cigarette smoking was developed and utilized to perform longitudinal 
studies of alterations in cardiovascular function. E-cigarette exposure led to 
the onset of cardiovascular disease similar to that with tobacco cigarette 
smoking. Impaired endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent vasodilation 
with increased adrenergic vasoconstriction were observed, paralleling the onset 
of systemic hypertension and subsequent cardiac hypertrophy. This cardiovascular 
toxicity was dependent on exposure duration and nicotine dose.

The recently discovered novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 virus), has 
brought the whole world to standstill with critical challenges, affecting both 
health and economic sectors worldwide. Although initially, this pandemic was 
associated with causing severe pulmonary and respiratory disorders, recent case 
studies reported the association of cerebrovascular-neurological dysfunction in 
COVID-19 patients, which is also life-threatening. Several SARS-CoV-2 positive 
case studies have been reported where there are mild or no symptoms of this 
virus. However, a selection of patients are suffering from large artery ischemic 
strokes. Although the pathophysiology of the SARS-CoV-2 virus affecting the 
cerebrovascular system has not been elucidated yet, researchers have identified 
several pathogenic mechanisms, including a role for the ACE2 receptor. 
Therefore, it is extremely crucial to identify the risk factors related to the 
progression and adverse outcome of cerebrovascular-neurological dysfunction in 
COVID-19 patients. Since many articles have reported the effect of smoking 
(tobacco and cannabis) and vaping in cerebrovascular and neurological systems, 
and considering that smokers are more prone to viral and bacterial infection 
compared to non-smokers, it is high time to explore the probable correlation of 
smoking in COVID-19 patients. Herein, we have reviewed the possible role of 
smoking and vaping on cerebrovascular and neurological dysfunction in COVID-19 
patients, along with potential pathogenic mechanisms associated with it.

E-cigarettes and Tobacco Exposure Biomarkers among American Indian Smokers.

Comiford AL, Rhoades DA, Spicer P, Ding K, Dvorak JD, Driskill L, Wagener TL, 
Doescher MP.

Objective We assessed associations between electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) 
use and smoking-related measures among American Indians (AIs) who smoke. 
MethodsWe collected baseline survey and smoking biomarker data in a cohort of 
375 adult AI smokers at a Cherokee Nation healthcare facility in Oklahoma. We 
used multivariate logistic and linear regression analyses to determine 
associations between e-cigarette use and smoking-related characteristics, 
including biomarkers. ResultsCurrent e-cigarette users were more likely than 
never users to report a quit attempt in the past 12 months (current vs never 
adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.24 [95% CI 1.20-4.16]). Current and past 
e-cigarette users were more likely than never users to report a likelihood to 
quit smoking (current vs never AOR = 2.97 [95% CI 1.34-6.56]; past vs never AOR 
= 1.77 [95% CI 1.08-2.91]). E-cigarette use was not significantly associated 
with confidence to quit smoking, cigarette packs smoked per day, or cotinine 
levels. ConclusionsE-cigarette use was associated with previous and future quit 
attempts, but not with reductions in cigarette smoking or confidence in 
quitting. This suggests that many dual users might benefit from the addition of 
evidence-based smoking cessation treatments.

Electronic cigarettes regulation in Indonesia has not been set yet. In the last 
4 years the electronic cigarettes have been widely distributed and used in 
Indonesia. Electronic cigarettes contain nicotine, propylene glycol, glycerol, 
liquid flavors, etc. All ingredients produce vapor when heated. Vapor and 
particles from electronic cigarettes affect the human health. Formaldehyde is 
known as a product of propylene glycol and glycerol vapor degradation. 
Formaldehyde is one of the chemical agents categorized as carcinogen. The aim of 
the research was to analyze the identification of formaldehyde vapor 
concentration and health complaint of electronic cigarettes smoker. The research 
was conducted in Surabaya city, Indonesia, from October 2015 to December 2016. 
The research used cross-sectional approach. Sample was obtained by purposive 
sampling that fulfilled samples inclusion criteria. The variables were the onset 
of smoking electronic cigarettes, smoking frequency of electronic cigarettes, 
formaldehyde vapor concentration, cotinine urine, and health complaint of 
electronic cigarettes smoker. The result showed that formaldehyde concentration 
in six vapors varied while cotinine urine mostly was positive. It is suggested 
to educate people about hazard of electronic cigarettes and to conduct further 
research to identify chemical agent in electronic cigarettes.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are a recent 
technology that has gained rapid acceptance. Still, little is known about them 
in terms of safety and effectiveness. A basic question is how effectively they 
deliver nicotine; however, the literature is surprisingly unclear on this point. 
Here, a population pharmacokinetic model was developed for nicotine and its 
major metabolite cotinine with the aim to provide a reliable framework for the 
simulation of nicotine and cotinine concentrations over time, based solely on 
inhalation airflow recordings and individual covariates [i.e., weight and breath 
carbon monoxide (CO) levels].
METHODS: This study included ten adults self-identified as heavy smokers (at 
least one pack of cigarettes per day). Plasma nicotine and cotinine 
concentrations were measured at regular 10-min intervals for 90 min while human 
subjects inhaled nicotine vapor from a modified e-cigarette. Airflow 
measurements were recorded every 200 ms throughout the session. A population 
pharmacokinetic model for nicotine and cotinine was developed based on 
previously published pharmacokinetic parameters and the airflow recordings. All 
of the analyses were performed with the non-linear mixed-effect modeling 
software NONMEM(®) version 7.2.
RESULTS: The results show that e-cigarettes deliver nicotine effectively, 
although the pharmacokinetic profiles are lower than those achieved with regular 
cigarettes. Our pharmacokinetic model effectively predicts plasma nicotine and 
cotinine concentrations from the inhalation volume, and initial breath CO.
CONCLUSION: E-cigarettes are effective at delivering nicotine. This new 
pharmacokinetic model of e-cigarette usage might be used for pharmacodynamic 
analysis where the pharmacokinetic profiles are not available.

Erratum in
    Pediatr Nephrol. 2021 May 31;:

BACKGROUND: We investigated the putative associations of alcohol, cigarette, 
e-cigarette, and marijuana use with kidney function and proteinuria among 
adolescents and young adults (AYA) with pediatric-onset chronic kidney disease 
(CKD) enrolled in the Chronic Kidney Disease in Children (CKiD) study.
METHODS: Participants responded to questions about past year and 30-day 
substance use. Associations between each substance and kidney function, 
proteinuria, nephrotic range proteinuria, and high blood pressure were 
separately estimated using repeated measures regression models, adjusting for 
sociodemographic characteristics. Models controlled for covariates at the 
present visit (contemporaneous) and additionally controlled for disease severity 
at the year prior to reporting substance use (lagged).
RESULTS: A total of 441 participants ≥16 years contributed 1,245 person-visits 
with 39% reporting alcohol and 16%, 17%, and 15% reporting cigarette, 
e-cigarette, and marijuana use, respectively, over the previous year. In 
adjusted lagged models, past year and 30-day cigarette use were significantly 
associated with higher levels of proteinuria (+18.6%, 95%CI: +2.8%, +36.9%; and 
+20.0%, 95%CI: +0.7%, +43.1%, respectively). Inferences were similar when 
controlling for secondhand smoke exposure.
CONCLUSIONS: In a cohort of AYA with pediatric kidney diseases, substance use 
was non-trivial, and cigarette use was associated with higher proteinuria, 
although the prevalence of use was low. Occasional alcohol, e-cigarette, and 
marijuana use were not associated with proteinuria, disease progression, or 
elevated blood pressure. Pediatric nephrologists as specialty care providers are 
well-positioned to discuss substance use and should encourage tobacco 
prevention/treatment efforts among AYA at high risk for use in order to preserve 
kidney function and promote well-being.

Electronic cigarettes is an unregulated commercially available nicotine 
dispensing tool. E-cigarettes contains nicotine which is a highly toxic chemical 
that can adversely affect any organ and is also potentially carcinogenic. 
Nicotine is the route to addiction and industry is using this drug to help 
people not forget tobacco. If not for nicotine these cigarettes will be useless. 
Thus it is just another way of keeping nicotine in blood to maintain cigarette 
smoking habits among existing customers and new way to attract young customers 
using technology to lure young minds, while serving purpose to deliver nicotine.

E-cigarettes, which deliver vaporized nicotine, have dramatically risen in 
popularity in recent years, despite many unanswered questions about safety, 
efficacy in reducing dependence, and overall impact on public health. Other 
factors, such as sex, also play an important role in determining behavioral and 
neurochemical responses to drugs of abuse. In these studies, we sought to 
develop a protocol for vaporized e-cigarette nicotine self-administration in 
rats, as a foundation to better understand the differing effects of nicotine 
exposure routes on behavior and physiological function. We report a novel method 
that elicits robust nicotine vapor self-administration in male and female rats. 
Our findings indicate that 5-mg/ml nicotine vape solution provides a high level 
of consistency in lever-pressing behavior for both males and females. Moreover, 
in male rats, we find that such e-cigarette nicotine vapor induces similar blood 
levels of nicotine's main metabolite, cotinine, as that found with intravenous 
nicotine self-administration. Therefore, the breathing pattern during vapor 
exposure in males leads to similar levels of titrated nicotine intake as with 
intravenous nicotine self-administration. Interestingly, a differential effect 
was found in the females, in which the same conditions of vapor exposure led to 
decreased cotinine levels with vapor compared to intravenous 
self-administration. Finally, differences in nicotine-mediated locomotion 
provide further support of the physiological effects of e-cigarette vapor 
inhalation. Taken together, our findings reveal important sex differences in 
nicotine intake based on the route of exposure, and we further establish a 
protocol for nicotine vapor self-administration in rats.

BACKGROUND: The association between the dual use of electronic cigarette 
(e-cigarette) and conventional cigarettes (c-cigarette) and spirometry-defined 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has not been studied thoroughly.
METHODS: A total of 47,217 participants were identified in the 2013-2018 Korea 
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey; of them, 12,919 participants 
aged ≥ 40 who underwent spirometry and had no missing data were enrolled. 
Pulmonary function testing, urinary cotinine, and urinary 
4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL) levels were compared 
between dual users, current smokers, former smokers, and non-users using complex 
sample linear regression analysis. The odds ratio (OR) for COPD was calculated 
using a complex sample logistic regression model after adjusting for covariates.
RESULTS: Among current e-cigarette users, approximately 85% of the participants 
used c-cigarette concurrently, and 1.3% of all the participants were dual users 
(2.3% in males and 0.1% in females). Both dual users and current smokers showed 
higher levels of urine cotinine and NNAL than non-users and former smokers. The 
weighted prevalence of COPD was the highest in dual users (13.8% for all 
participants and 14.1% for males). The multivariate-adjusted OR of COPD for male 
dual users, compared to non-users, was 3.46 (Ptrend < 0.001). The OR for COPD 
was 3.10 (Ptrend < 0.001) in middle-aged (40-64 years) and 3.70 (Ptrend < 0.001) 
in older (≥ 65 years) men. In females, the association was not observed and 
could not be precisely measured because of the small proportion of the smoking 
population.
CONCLUSIONS: Dual use of e-cigarette and c-cigarette is associated with COPD in 
males.

regression models were used to examine associations between e-cigarette use or 
dual use and MetS and its components. Prevalence ratios (PRs) with 95% 
confidence intervals (95% CI) were estimated.
RESULTS: Current and former e-cigarette users were 30% (95% CI: 1.13, 1.50) and 
15% (95% CI: 1.03, 1.28) more likely to have MetS than never e-cigarette users. 
Current or former e-cigarette use was also associated with elevated 
triglycerides, reduced high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and elevated 
blood pressure (AOR ranged from 1.15 to 1.42, all P < 0.05). The prevalence of 
MetS for dual users was 1.35-fold (95% CI: 1.15, 1.58) higher than that for 
never smokers and 1.21-fold (95% CI: 1.00, 1.46) higher than that for 
combustible cigarette-only users. Dual users were also more likely to report 
elevated triglycerides and reduced HDL cholesterol than never smokers or 
combustible cigarette-only users (all P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: E-cigarette use or dual use is associated with MetS. Our findings 
may inform tobacco control policies regarding regulations of e-cigarette use.

BACKGROUND: Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) have drastically changed the 
nicotine and tobacco product landscape. However, their potential public health 
impact is still unclear. A reliable and valid measure of e-cigarette dependence 
would likely advance assessment and prognostication of the public health impact 
of e-cigarettes. The aim of this research was to examine the internal 
consistency, structure, and validity of three e-cigarette dependence scales.
METHODS: Adult dual users (smokers who also vape, N = 256) enrolled in an 
observational cohort study (45.1% women, 70.7% white). At baseline, participants 
completed the e-cigarette Fagerström Test of Cigarette Dependence (e-FTCD), the 
e-cigarette Wisconsin Inventory of Smoking Dependence Motives (e-WISDM), and the 
Penn State Electronic Cigarette Dependence Index (PS-ECDI). All participants 
provided a urine sample for cotinine analysis and reported e-cigarette use at 1 
year.
RESULTS: The e-WISDM subscales had the highest internal consistency (α = 
.81-.96), then the PS-ECDI (α = .74) and e-FTCD (α = .51). A single-factor 
structure for the e-FTCD and an 11-factor structure for the e-WISDM were 
supported, but the PS-ECDI did not have a single-factor structure. All three 
e-cigarette dependence scales were highly correlated with validation criteria 
including continued e-cigarette use at 1 year, but not with e-liquid nicotine 
concentration or cotinine.
CONCLUSIONS: The e-WISDM and PS-ECDI had stronger internal consistency than did 
the e-FTCD, despite the e-FTCD's single-factor structure, but all 3 measures 
appear to be valid measures of e-cigarette dependence as suggested by their 
significant relations with self-perceived addiction, heavy use, early use after 
overnight deprivation, and continued use over time.
IMPLICATIONS: This research provides empirical support for three e-cigarette 
dependence measures: the e-FTCD, the PS-ECDI, and the e-WISDM among dual users 
of e-cigarettes and combustible cigarettes. The PS-ECDI and e-WISDM are more 
reliable, but all three measures were strongly correlated with key dependence 
constructs such as heavy use and continued use over time.

Electronic cigarettes (ECs) are nicotine delivery devices that are proposed as 
tobacco harm reduction products to smokers. Nicotine delivery from ECs is 
potentially important in their efficacy as smoking substitutes. Herein, nicotine 
delivery from using a new-generation EC device (variable-wattage, set at 9 W) 
was evaluated, comparing experienced (vapers) with naïve users (smokers). 
Twenty-four vapers and 23 smokers participated to the study. They were asked to 
obtain 10 puffs in 5 minutes and then use the EC ad lib for 60 more minutes 
(total duration of use: 65 minutes). An 18 mg/mL nicotine-containing liquid was 
used. Blood samples were obtained at baseline, 5-minutes and every 15 minutes 
thereafter, while number of puffs and average puff duration were recorded. 
Although at baseline both groups had similar plasma nicotine levels, smokers 
consistently exhibited lower levels at all time-periods; at 5-minutes the levels 
were lower by 46%, while during the subsequent period they were lower by 43% (at 
65-minutes) to 54% (at 20-minutes). Both groups took similar number of puffs, 
but smokers had average puff duration of 2.3 s compared to 3.5 s in vapers. Even 
in vapers, plasma nicotine levels at 5 minutes were lower than those observed 
after smoking 1 tobacco cigarette.

Nicotine is the primary addictive substance in tobacco smoke and electronic 
cigarette (e-cig) vapour. Methodological limitations have made it difficult to 
compare the role of the nicotine and non-nicotine constituents of tobacco smoke. 
The aim of this study was to compare the effects of traditional cigarette smoke 
and e-cig vapour containing the same amount of nicotine in male BALB/c mice 
exposed to the smoke of 21 cigarettes or e-cig vapour containing 16.8 mg of 
nicotine delivered by means of a mechanical ventilator for three 30-min 
sessions/day for seven weeks. One hour after the last session, half of the 
animals were sacrificed for neurochemical analysis, and the others underwent 
mecamylamine-precipitated or spontaneous withdrawal for the purposes of 
behavioural analysis. Chronic intermittent non-contingent, second-hand exposure 
to cigarette smoke or e-cig vapour led to similar brain cotinine and nicotine 
levels, similar urine cotinine levels and the similar up-regulation of α4β2 
nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in different brain areas, but had different 
effects on body weight, food intake, and the signs of mecamylamine-precipitated 
and spontaneous withdrawal episodic memory and emotional responses. The findings 
of this study demonstrate for the first time that e-cig vapour induces 
addiction-related neurochemical, physiological and behavioural alterations. The 
fact that inhaled cigarette smoke and e-cig vapour have partially different 
dependence-related effects indicates that compounds other than nicotine 
contribute to tobacco dependence.

Most of electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) users are also smoking tobacco 
cigarettes. Because of the relative novelty of this habit, very little is known 
on the impact of vaping on pulmonary health, even less on the potential 
interactions of dual e-cigarette and tobacco cigarette use. Therefore, we used 
well-established mouse models to investigate the impact of dual exposure to 
e-cigarette vapors and tobacco cigarette smoke on lung homeostasis. Groups of 
female BALB/c mice were exposed to room air, tobacco smoke only, nicotine-free 
flavor-free e-cigarette vapors only or both tobacco smoke and e-cigarette 
vapors. Moreover, since tobacco smoke and electronic cigarette vapors both 
affect circadian processes in the lungs, groups of mice were euthanized at two 
different time points during the day. We found that dual-exposed mice had 
altered lung circadian gene expression compared with mice exposed to tobacco 
smoke alone. Dual-exposed mice also had different frequencies of dendritic 
cells, macrophages, and neutrophils in the lung tissue compared with mice 
exposed to tobacco smoke alone, an observation also valid for B-lymphocytes and 
CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes. Exposure to e-cigarette vapors also impacted the 
levels of immunoglobulins in the bronchoalveolar lavage and serum. Finally, 
e-cigarette and dual exposures increased airway resistance compared with mice 
exposed to room air or tobacco smoke alone, respectively. Taken together, these 
data suggest that e-cigarette vapors, even without nicotine or flavors, could 
affect how the lungs react to tobacco cigarette smoke exposure in dual users, 
potentially altering the pathological course triggered by smoking.

OBJECTIVES: Although smoking is known to have a negative impact in patients with 
metabolic syndrome (MetS), only a few studies have examined the association 
between electronic cigarette (e-cig) use and MetS.
METHODS: Among 22,948 participants in the 6th Korea National Health and 
Nutrition Examination Survey, 14,738 (13,459 [91.3%] never, 954 [6.5%] ever, and 
325 [2.2%] current e-cig users) were selected. The relationship between e-cig 
exposure and MetS (based on the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult 
Treatment Panel [NCEP-ATP] III criteria) was evaluated using a multivariable 
logistic regression analysis. An unweighted analysis was performed to evaluate 
this association without a sampling weight. A subgroup analysis was performed 
among active smokers to compare dual users with never e-cig users.
RESULTS: Among current e-cig users, 85.0% were dual users, 12.7% were former 
cigarette users, and 2.2% were only e-cig users. After adjustment for 
covariates, abdominal obesity and hypertriglyceridemia were significantly 
associated with current e-cig exposure (odds ratio [OR]: 1.88, 95% confidence 
interval [CI]: 1.41-2.50 and OR: 1.32, 95% CI: 1.00-1.74 respectively [compared 
with the never e-cig users group]). Compared with never e-cig users, current 
e-cig users showed an OR of 1.27 (95% CI: 0.96-1.70, Ptrend = 0.01) for MetS. In 
the unweighted analysis, the OR for MetS in current e-cig users was 1.40 (95% 
CI: 1.08-1.81, Ptrend <0.01). Compared with never e-cig users, dual users showed 
a higher OR for abdominal obesity (OR: 1.71, 95% CI: 1.25-2.34, Ptrend <0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Current e-cig exposure was associated with an increased risk of 
MetS. Dual use of e-cigs and cigarettes was associated with abdominal obesity. 
Further longitudinal studies and better assessment of e-cig use and type are 
needed to clarify this relationship.

Nicotine is a highly addictive principal component of both tobacco and 
electronic cigarette that is readily absorbed in blood. Nicotine-containing 
electronic cigarettes are promoted as a safe alternative to cigarette smoking. 
However, the isolated effects of inhaled nicotine are largely unknown. Here we 
report a novel rat model of aerosolized nicotine with a particle size (~1 μm) in 
the respirable diameter range. Acute nicotine inhalation caused increased 
pulmonary edema and lung injury as measured by enhanced bronchoalveolar lavage 
fluid protein, IgM, lung wet-to-dry weight ratio, and high-mobility group box 1 
(HMGB1) protein and decreased lung E-cadherin protein. Immunohistochemical 
analysis revealed congested blood vessels and increased neutrophil infiltration. 
Lung myeloperoxidase mRNA and protein increased in the nicotine-exposed rats. 
Complete blood counts also showed an increase in neutrophils, white blood cells, 
eosinophils, and basophils. Arterial blood gas measurements showed an increase 
in lactate. Lungs of nicotine-inhaling animals revealed increased mRNA levels of 
IL-1A and CXCL1. There was also an increase in IL-1α protein. In in vitro 
air-liquid interface cultures of airway epithelial cells, there was a dose 
dependent increase in HMGB1 release with nicotine treatment. Air-liquid cultures 
exposed to nicotine also resulted in a dose-dependent loss of barrier as 
measured by transepithelial electrical resistance and a decrease in E-cadherin 
expression. Nicotine also caused a dose-dependent increase in epithelial cell 
death and an increase in caspase-3/7 activities. These results show that the 
nicotine content of electronic cigarettes may have adverse pulmonary and 
systemic effects.

Nicotine is a naturally occurring and highly addictive chemical used in 
e-cigarettes, cigarettes, chewing tobacco, and other tobacco products as well as 
in nicotine replacement therapies. The negative health consequences of using 
nicotine-containing products are well known. In fact, smoking remains the 
leading cause of preventable disease, disability, and death in the United 
States. Measurement of nicotine and its metabolites, cotinine and 3-OH-cotinine, 
offers an objective method to evaluate nicotine exposure and the associated 
health risks. In this chapter, we describe a quick and reliable isotope dilution 
LC-MS/MS method for the quantitation of these three compounds in 60 μL of human 
urine following a simple sample preparation procedure. Electrospray Ionization 
(ESI) in positive mode is used to introduce the analytes into the mass 
spectrometer and quantitation is achieved using Multiple Reaction Monitoring 
(MRM). The analytical measurable ranges for nicotine and cotinine are 
10-2500 ng/mL and 20-5000 ng/mL for 3-OH-cotinine.

RATIONALE: There is limited understanding regarding how various e-cigarette 
flavorings may influence the behavior of non-regular e-cigarette users who are 
regular cigarette smokers.
OBJECTIVES: To assess differences in nicotine delivery, puffing topography, 
subjective effects, and user satisfaction from different flavored e-liquids.
METHODS: Eighteen daily smokers (average age, 44.1 ± 7.0; 9 males; average CPD, 
13.0 ± 5.8) smoked their tobacco cigarettes during an initial visit and returned 
five times to try an e-cigarette (eGo type) refilled with a nicotine solution 
(24 mg/ml) of five different flavors: cherry, tobacco, espresso, menthol, and 
vanilla (randomized order). Assessments at each visit included puffing 
topography, blood samples for nicotine analysis, and subjective reports of 
nicotine effects and flavor satisfaction.
RESULTS: Vaping different flavors resulted in different levels of plasma 
nicotine. The flavor producing the highest plasma nicotine concentration (Cmax) 
was cherry (median 21.2 ng/ml), which was not significantly different than 
nicotine delivery from a combustible cigarette (29.2 ng/ml, p > .05). Vanilla 
e-liquid produced the lowest Cmax (9.7 ng/ml), and participants tended to puff 
less frequently on vanilla compared to tobacco flavor (p = .013). Flavors did 
not differ significantly in the speed of nicotine delivery (Tmax). During 
controlled use, puff duration for all flavors was significantly longer than a 
combustible cigarette (p < 0.05). After controlling for nicotine delivery, 
significant differences in flavor enjoyment were detected. Menthol flavored 
e-liquid was rated as more enjoyable than vanilla and tobacco flavored e-liquids 
(p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Flavors tested in this study yielded different patterns of nicotine 
delivery and led to differences in reduction in smoking urges.

This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of e-cigarette refill liquid 
administration alone or with nicotine on the antioxidant defense status, 
functional and histopathological changes in adult rat liver tissue. For this 
purpose, 32 rats were treated for 28 days as follows: control group was injected 
intra-peritoneally with physiological saline; e-cigarette 0% treated group 
received an intra-peritoneal injection of e-liquid without nicotine diluted in 
physiological saline, e-cigarette-treated group received an intra-peritoneal 
injection of e-liquid containing 0.5 mg of nicotine/kg of body weight/day 
diluted in physiological saline and nicotine-treated group received an 
intra-peritoneal injection of 0.5 mg of nicotine/kg of body weight/day diluted 
in physiological saline. In e-liquid without nicotine-exposed group, activities 
of the liver biomarkers aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, 
alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase increase. Interestingly, 
oxidative stress indicators showed decreased total protein content, associated 
with a reduction in the antioxidant enzymes activities superoxide dismutase, 
catalase and glutathione-S-transferase, and an elevation in malondialdehyde 
content, highlighting the promotion of lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress. 
Histological studies identified inflammatory cells infiltration and cell death. 
Thus, e-liquid seems to promote oxidative tissue injuries, which in turn lead to 
the observed histopathological finding. In comparison, nicotine alone induced 
less oxidative stress and less histopathological disorders, whereas e-liquid 
with nicotine gave rise to more histopathological injuries. Thereby, e-liquid, 
per se, is able to induce hepatotoxicity and supplementation with nicotine 
worsens this state.

Understanding potential mechanisms of harm: the drivers of electronic 
cigarette-induced changes in alveolar macrophages, neutrophils, and lung 
epithelial cells.

Electronic (e-) cigarettes are growing in popularity despite uncertainties 
regarding their long-term health implications. The link between cigarette 
smoking and initiation of chronic lung disease took decades to unpick so in 
vitro studies mimicking e-cigarette exposure aim to detect early indicators of 
harm. In response to e-cigarette exposure, alveolar macrophages adopt a 
proinflammatory phenotype of increased secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, 
reduction in phagocytosis, and efferocytosis and reactive oxygen species 
generation. These effects are largely driven by free radical exposure, changes 
in PI3K/Akt signaling pathways, nicotine-induced reduction in phagocytosis 
receptors, and impaired lipid homeostasis leading to a foam-like lipid-laden 
phenotype. Neutrophils exhibit disrupted chemotaxis and transmigration to 
chemokines, reduced phagocytosis and bacterial killing, and an increase in 
protease secretion without corresponding antiproteases in response to 
e-cigarette exposure. This is driven by an altered ability to respond and to 
polarize toward chemoattractants, an activation of the p38 MAPK signaling 
pathway and inability to assemble NADPH oxidase. E-cigarettes induce lung 
epithelial cells to display decreased ciliary beat frequency and ion channel 
conductance as well as changes in chemokine secretion and surface protein 
expression. Changes in gene expression, mitochondrial function, and signaling 
pathways have been demonstrated in lung epithelial cells to explain these 
changes. Many functional outputs of alveolar macrophages, neutrophils, and lung 
epithelial cells have not been fully explored in the context of e-cigarette 
exposure and the underlying driving mechanisms are poorly understood. This 
review discusses current evidence surrounding the effects of e-cigarettes on 
alveolar macrophages, neutrophils, and lung epithelial cells with particular 
focus on the cellular mechanisms of change.

The development of electronic cigarettes (e-cigs) has the potential to offer a 
less harmful alternative for tobacco users. This clinical study was designed to 
characterize e-cig users' exposure to nicotine, and to investigate the acute 
effects of e-cigs on the hemodynamic measurements (blood pressure and heart 
rate) in comparison with the effects of regular smoking. Five e-cigs and one 
Marlboro® cigarette were randomized for twenty-three participants under two 
exposure scenarios from Day 1 to Day 11: half-hour controlled administration and 
one hour ad lib use. The nicotine plasma concentrations after 1.5h of product 
use (C90) were significantly lower in the users of e-cigs than of Marlboro® 
cigarettes. The combination of glycerin and propylene glycol as the vehicle 
facilitated delivery of more nicotine than glycerin alone. The heart rate, 
systolic and diastolic blood pressure were significantly elevated after use of 
Marlboro® cigarettes, but the elevation was less after use of most of the 
e-cigs. Use of e-cigs had no impact on the exhaled CO levels, whereas the 
Marlboro® cigarette significantly increased the exhaled CO more than 8 times 
above the baseline. In conclusion, e-cigs could be a less harmful alternative 
for tobacco users.

Health Education, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA.

Electronic cigarettes (EC) are commonly marketed as a safe alternative to 
traditional tobacco cigarettes (TC), but recent studies have observed adverse 
effects on vascular functions from EC vapours similar to those observed from TC. 
Currently, it is not clear if differing levels of nicotine and compounds from 
heating in e-cigarettes influence vascular functions. Sixteen young, apparently 
healthy tobacco product naïve participants were studied. Each participant 
underwent three separate "vaping" trials with menthol-flavoured quit smoking 
aid, electronically heated menthol-flavoured EC with 0% or 5.4% nicotine. During 
each visit, measurements were performed at baseline, immediately post, 1, and 
2 h post-EC exposure. There were no significant changes in heart rate, systolic 
and diastolic blood pressure, endothelial function (via flow-mediated dilation), 
and arterial stiffness (via cardio-ankle vascular index) throughout the 
experiments. In conclusion, vaping electronic cigarettes did not produce acute 
and persistent effects on subclinical vascular functions over the course of a 
2-h trial in young, healthy, tobacco product naïve participants.

BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is the main cause of death in the United 
States, with smoking being the primary preventable cause of premature death, and 
thrombosis being the main mechanism of cardiovascular mortality in smokers. Due 
to the perception that electronic/e-cigarettes are "safer/less harmful" than 
conventional cigarettes, their usage-among a variety of ages-has increased 
tremendously during the past decade. Notably, there are limited studies 
regarding the negative effects of e-cigarettes on the cardiovascular system, 
which is also the subject of significant debate.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We employed a passive e-VapeTM vapor inhalation system and 
developed an in vivo whole-body e-cigarette mouse exposure protocol that mimics 
real-life human exposure scenarios/conditions and investigated the effects of 
e-cigarettes and clean air on platelet function and thrombogenesis. Our results 
show that platelets from e-cigarette-exposed mice are hyperactive, with enhanced 
aggregation, dense and α granule secretion, activation of the αIIbβ3 integrin, 
phosphatidylserine expression, and Akt and ERK activation, when compared with 
clean air-exposed platelets. E-cigarette-exposed platelets were also found to be 
resistant to inhibition by prostacyclin, relative to clean air. Furthermore, the 
e-cigarette-exposed mice exhibited a shortened thrombosis occlusion and bleeding 
times.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our data demonstrate for the first time that 
e-cigarettes alter physiological hemostasis and increase the risk of 
thrombogenic events. This is attributable, at least in part, to the hyperactive 
state of platelets. Thus, the negative health consequences of e-cigarette 
exposure should not be underestimated and warrant further investigation.

The diffusion of e-cigarette (e-CIG) opens a great scientific and regulatory 
debate about its safety. The huge number of commercialized devices, e-liquids 
with almost infinite chemical formulations and the growing market demand for a 
rapid and efficient toxicity screen system that is able to test all of these 
references and related aerosols. A consensus on the best protocols for the e-CIG 
safety assessment is still far to be achieved, since the huge number of 
variables characterizing these products (e.g., flavoring type and concentration, 
nicotine concentration, type of the device, including the battery and the 
atomizer). This suggests that more experimental evidences are needed to support 
the regulatory frameworks. The present study aims to contribute in this field by 
testing the effects of condensed aerosols (CAs) from three main e-liquid 
categories (tobacco, mint, and cinnamon as food-related flavor), with (18 mg/mL) 
or without nicotine. Two in vitro models, represented by a monoculture of human 
epithelial alveolar cells and a three-dimensional (3D) co-culture of alveolar 
and lung microvascular endothelial cells were used. Cell viability, 
pro-inflammatory cytokines release and alveolar-blood barrier (ABB) integrity 
were investigated as inhalation toxicity endpoints. Results showed that nicotine 
itself had almost no influence on the modulation of the toxicity response, while 
flavor composition did have. The cell viability was significantly decreased in 
monoculture and ABB after exposure to the mints and cinnamon CAs. The barrier 
integrity was significantly affected in the ABB after exposure to cytotoxic CAs. 
With the exception of the significant IL-8 release in the monoculture after 
Cinnamon exposure, no increase of inflammatory cytokines (IL-8 and MCP-1) 
release was observed. These findings point out that multiple assays with 
different in vitro models are able to discriminate the acute inhalation toxicity 
of CAs from liquids with different flavors, providing the companies and 
regulatory bodies with useful tools for the preliminary screening of marketable 
products.

Update of
    Res Sq. 2020 May 18;:

Electronic cigarette (e-cig) vaping is increasing rapidly in the United States, 
as e-cigs are considered less harmful than combustible cigarettes. However, 
limited research has been conducted to understand the possible mechanisms that 
mediate toxicity and pulmonary health effects of e-cigs. We hypothesized that 
sub-chronic e-cig exposure induces inflammatory response and dysregulated 
repair/extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, which occur through the α7 
nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChRα7). Adult wild-type (WT), nAChRα7 
knockout (KO), and lung epithelial cell-specific KO (nAChRα7 CreCC10) mice were 
exposed to e-cig aerosol containing propylene glycol (PG) with or without 
nicotine. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF) and lung tissues were collected 
to determine e-cig induced inflammatory response and ECM remodeling, 
respectively. Sub-chronic e-cig exposure with nicotine increased inflammatory 
cellular influx of macrophages and T-lymphocytes including increased 
pro-inflammatory cytokines in BALF and increased SARS-Cov-2 Covid-19 ACE2 
receptor, whereas nAChRα7 KO mice show reduced inflammatory responses associated 
with decreased ACE2 receptor. Interestingly, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), 
such as MMP2, MMP8 and MMP9, were altered both at the protein and mRNA 
transcript levels in female and male KO mice, but WT mice exposed to PG alone 
showed a sex-dependent phenotype. Moreover, MMP12 was increased significantly in 
male mice exposed to PG with or without nicotine in a nAChRα7-dependent manner. 
Additionally, sub-chronic e-cig exposure with or without nicotine altered the 
abundance of ECM proteins, such as collagen and fibronectin, significantly in a 
sex-dependent manner, but without the direct role of nAChRα7 gene. Overall, 
sub-chronic e-cig exposure with or without nicotine affected lung inflammation 
and repair responses/ECM remodeling, which were mediated by nAChRα7 in a 
sex-dependent manner.

Electronic cigarettes (e-cigs) are devices designed to deliver nicotine in a 
vaping solution rather than smoke and without tobacco combustion. Perceived as a 
safer alternative to conventional cigarettes, e-cigs are aggressively marketed 
as lifestyle-choice consumables, thanks to few restrictions and a lack of 
regulatory guidelines. E-cigs have also gained popularity among never-smokers 
and teenagers, becoming an emergent public health issue. Despite the burgeoning 
worldwide consumption of e-cigs, their safety remains largely unproven and it is 
unknown whether these devices cause in vivo toxicological effects that could 
contribute to cancer. Here we demonstrate the co-mutagenic and cancer-initiating 
effects of e-cig vapour in a rat lung model. We found that e-cigs have a 
powerful booster effect on phase-I carcinogen-bioactivating enzymes, including 
activators of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and increase oxygen free 
radical production and DNA oxidation to 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine. 
Furthermore, we found that e-cigs damage DNA not only at chromosomal level in 
peripheral blood, such as strand breaks in leucocytes and micronuclei formation 
in reticulocytes, but also at gene level such as point mutations in urine. Our 
results demonstrate that exposure to e-cigs could endanger human health, 
particularly among younger more vulnerable consumers.

Proteases such as neutrophil elastase cleave and activate the epithelial sodium 
channel (ENaC), causing airway dehydration. Our current study explores the 
impact of increased protease levels in vapers' airways on ENaC activity and 
airway dehydration. Human bronchial epithelial cultures (HBECs) were exposed to 
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from non-smokers, smokers and vapers. Airway 
surface liquid (ASL) height was measured by confocal microscopy as a marker of 
hydration. ENaC cleavage was measured by Western blotting. Human peripheral 
blood neutrophils were treated with a menthol-flavored e-liquid (Juul), and the 
resulting secretions were added to HBECs. BALF from smokers and vapers 
significantly and equally increased ENaC activity and decreased ASL height. The 
ASL height decrease was attenuated by protease inhibitors. Non-smokers' BALF had 
no effect on ENaC or ASL height. BALF from smokers and vapers, but not 
non-smokers, induced ENaC cleavage. E-liquid-treated neutrophil secretions 
cleaved ENaC and decreased ASL height. Our study demonstrated that elevated 
protease levels in vapers' airways have functional significance since they can 
activate ENaC, resulting in airway dehydration. Lung dehydration contributes to 
diseases like cystic fibrosis (CF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
and asthma. Thus, our data predict that vaping, like smoking, will cause airway 
surface dehydration that likely leads to lung disease.

Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) have rapidly increased in popularity within 
the last 2 years in Malaysia. The study aims to understand the association 
between e-cigarette use behaviors and salivary cotinine (a CYP2AA metabolite of 
nicotine) concentration to inform the development of future e-cigarette control 
policies. A convenience sample of saliva from 144 e-cigarette users was obtained 
between November and December 2015. The study participants used refill liquid 
containing between 0 and 12 mg/ml of nicotine. The overall median cotinine 
concentration of the study participants was 81.1 ng/ml (interquartile range = 
8.5-195.8). Among the zero-nicotine and single e-cigarette users, the median 
cotinine level was 51.1 (interquartile range = 8.20-125.35) ng/ml. Factors 
significantly associated with a higher salivary cotinine concentration were dual 
use of e-cigarettes and tobacco cigarettes, regular and daily e-cigarette use, a 
longer duration of e-cigarette use, using a higher amount of e-liquid, and a 
shorter duration to finish a refill. Multivariate analysis revealed that 
e-cigarette use of 1-6 and 6-12 months (but not 1 month and below) was 
significantly associated with a higher cotinine concentration. Cotinine found in 
zero-nicotine e-liquids implies the importance of stringent regulatory 
governance for the consistency of labeled nicotine content of e-cigarette liquid 
in the market. Zero-nicotine e-cigarette users should also be informed of the 
likelihood of environmental exposure to tobacco smoke. Future studies conducted 
on larger samples are warranted to validate the association between duration of 
e-cigarette use and salivary cotinine concentration as well as to investigate 
underlying mechanisms.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Modified risk products (MRP) are promoted as a safer 
alternative to traditional combustion cigarettes (TCC) in chronic smokers. 
Evidence for their lower hazardous profile is building, despite several 
controversies. Yet, it is unclear whether individual responses to MRP differ 
among consumers. We hypothesized that different clusters of subjects exist in 
terms of acute effects of MRP.
RECENT FINDINGS: Pooling data from a total of 60 individuals, cluster analysis 
identified at least three clusters (labelled 1 to 3) of subjects with different 
electronic vaping cigarettes (EVC) effects and at least two clusters (labelled 4 
to 5) of subjects with different heat-not-burn cigarettes (HNBC) effects. 
Specifically, oxidative stress, platelet aggregation, and endothelial 
dysfunction after EVC were significantly different cluster-wise (all p < 0.05), 
and oxidative stress and platelet aggregation after HNBC were significantly 
different (all p < 0.05). In particular, subjects belonging to Cluster 1 
appeared to have less detrimental responses to EVC usage than subjects in 
Cluster 2 and 3, as shown by non-significant changes in flow-mediated dilation 
(FMD) and less marked increase in Nox2-derived peptide (NOX). Conversely, those 
assigned to Cluster 3 had the worst reaction in terms of changes in FMD, NOX, 
and P-selectin. Furthermore, individuals belonging to Cluster 4 responded 
unfavorably to both HNBC and EVC, whereas those in Cluster 5 interestingly 
showed less adverse results after using HNBC than EVC. Results for main analyses 
were consistent employing different clusters, tests, and bootstrap. Individual 
responses to MRP differ and smokers aiming at using EVC or HNBC as a risk 
reduction strategy should consider trying different MRP aiming at finding the 
one which is less detrimental, with subjects resembling those in Cluster 1 
preferably using EVC and those resembling Cluster 5 preferably using HNBC.

Most electronic cigarettes (e-cigs) aerosolize a nicotine-containing liquid that 
users inhale. Few experimental studies have examined e-cig abuse liability (the 
extent to which use of these products may lead to persistent and/or problematic 
use). In this study, 24 experienced male e-cig users completed 4 sessions that 
differed byproduct used: own e-cig (OWN), an eGo e-cig filled with participants' 
own brand/flavor liquid in 0 mg/mL nicotine (e-cig0), an eGo e-cig filled with 
the highest nicotine concentration available in participants' own brand/flavor 
(e-cighighest), and a U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved nicotine 
inhaler (IN). Outcome measures included crossover point on the multiple-choice 
procedure, plasma nicotine delivery, and subjective effect profile. After 10 
puffs, a significantly higher mean crossover point was observed for OWN at $1.35 
(SD = 0.90) compared to e-cighighest at $0.88 (SD = 0.89), e-cig0 at $0.83 (SD = 
0.79), and IN at $0.72 (SD = 0.84). Significant increases in mean plasma 
nicotine concentration were observed for OWN at 7.94 ng/mL (SD = 6.19) and 
e-cighighest at 7.51 ng/mL (SD = 5.39). Significant reductions in abstinence 
symptom suppression and higher ratings of satisfaction were observed for OWN and 
e-cighighest, with significantly less suppression and lower ratings of 
satisfaction for e-cig0 and IN. These findings suggest that human laboratory 
methods can be used to assess e-cig abuse liability and that nicotine-containing 
e-cigs have greater abuse liability than nicotine-free e-cigs and the IN. 
Potential regulations intended to limit e-cig abuse liability should be tested 
using these or similar procedures. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all

INTRODUCTION: Electronic cigarette (EC) use has increased rapidly in the last 
decade, especially among youth. Regulating nicotine delivery from ECs could help 
curb youth uptake and leverage EC use in harm reduction yet is complicated by 
varying device and liquid variables that affect nicotine delivery. Nicotine 
flux, the nicotine emission rate, is a parameter that incorporates these 
variables and focuses on the performance rather than the design of an EC. 
Nicotine flux therefore could be a powerful regulatory tool if it is shown 
empirically to predict nicotine delivery and subjective effects related to 
dependence.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This project consists of two complementary clinical 
trials. In Trial I, we will examine the relationship between nicotine flux and 
the rate and dose of nicotine delivery from ECs, hence, impacting abuse 
liability. It will also examine the extent to which this relationship is 
mediated by nicotine form (i.e., freebase versus protonated). At Yale School of 
Medicine (YSM), study participants will puff EC devices under conditions that 
differ by flux and form, while arterial blood is sampled in high time 
resolution. In Trial II, we will assess the relationship between nicotine flux, 
form, and subjective effects. At the American University of Beirut (AUB), 
participants will use EC devices with varying nicotine fluxes and forms, while 
dependency measures, such as the urge to use ECs, nicotine craving, and 
withdrawal symptoms, will be assessed. We will also monitor puffing intensity 
and real-time exposure to toxicants.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The protocol of Trial I and Trial II was approved by 
YSM and AUB IRBs, respectively. We will disseminate study results through 
peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT05706701 for Trial I and NCT05430334 for Trial II.

Inhalation of tobacco smoke has been linked to increased risk of viral 
infection, such as influenza. Inhalation of electronic-cigarette (e-cigarette) 
aerosol has also recently been linked to immune suppression within the 
respiratory tract, specifically the nasal mucosa. We propose that changes in the 
nasal mucosal immune response modify antiviral host-defense responses in 
e-cigarette users. Nonsmokers, cigarette smokers, and e-cigarette users were 
inoculated with live-attenuated influenza virus (LAIV) to safely examine the 
innate immune response to influenza infection. Before and after LAIV 
inoculation, we collected nasal epithelial-lining fluid, nasal lavage fluid, 
nasal-scrape biopsy specimens, urine, and blood. Endpoints examined include 
cytokines and chemokines, influenza-specific IgA, immune-gene expression, and 
markers of viral load. Statistical analysis included primary comparisons of 
cigarette and e-cigarette groups with nonsmokers, as well as secondary analysis 
of demographic factors as potential modifiers. Markers of viral load did not 
differ among the three groups. Nasal-lavage-fluid anti-LAIV IgA levels increased 
in nonsmokers after LAIV inoculation but did not increase in e-cigarette users 
and cigarette smokers. LAIV-induced gene-expression changes in nasal biopsy 
specimens differed in cigarette smokers and e-cigarette users as compared with 
nonsmokers, with a greater number of genes changed in e-cigarette users, mostly 
resulting in decreased expression. The top downregulated genes in cigarette 
smokers were SMPD3, NOS2A, and KLRB1, and the top downregulated genes in 
e-cigarette users were MR1, NT5E, and HRAS. Similarly, LAIV-induced cytokine 
levels in nasal epithelial-lining fluid differed among the three groups, 
including decreased antiviral host-defense mediators (IFNγ, IL6, and IL12p40). 
We also detected that sex interacted with tobacco-product exposure to modify 
LAIV-induced immune-gene expression. Our results demonstrate that e-cigarette 
use altered nasal LAIV-induced immune responses, including gene expression, 
cytokine and chemokine release, and LAIV-specific IgA levels. Together, these 
data suggest that e-cigarette use induces changes in the nasal mucosa that are 
consistent with the potential for altered respiratory antiviral host-defense 
function.Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02019745).

INTRODUCTION: Cannabis and tobacco couse is common and could expose users to 
higher levels of toxicants. No studies have examined biomarkers of toxicant 
exposure in cousers of cannabis and cigarettes, compared with cigarette smokers 
(CS).
AIMS AND METHODS: Adult daily CS were recruited from 10 US sites for a study of 
reduced nicotine cigarettes. In this analysis of baseline data, participants 
were categorized as either cousers of cannabis and tobacco (cousers; N = 167; 
urine positive for 11-nor-9-carboxy-Δ 9-tetrahydrocannnabinol and self-reported 
cannabis use ≥1×/week), or CS (N = 911; negative urine and no self-reported 
cannabis use). Participants who did not meet either definition (N = 172) were 
excluded. Self-reported tobacco and cannabis use and tobacco and/or 
combustion-related biomarkers of exposure were compared between groups.
RESULTS: Compared to CS, cousers were younger (couser Mage = 38.96, SD = 13.01; 
CS Mage = 47.22, SD = 12.72; p < .001) and more likely to be male (cousers = 
67.7%, CS = 51.9%, p < .001). There were no group differences in self-reported 
cigarettes/day, total nicotine equivalents, or breath carbon monoxide, but 
cousers had greater use of non-cigarette tobacco products. Compared to CS, 
cousers had higher concentrations of 3-hydroxypropylmercapturic acid, 
2-cyanoethylmercapturic acid, S-phenylmercapturic acid, 
3-hydroxy-1-methylpropylmercapturic acid (ps < .05), and phenanthrene tetraol (p 
< .001). No biomarkers were affected by number of cannabis use days/week or days 
since last cannabis use during baseline (ps > .05).
CONCLUSIONS: Cousers had higher concentrations of biomarkers of exposure than 
CS, but similar number of cigarettes per day and nicotine exposure. Additional 
studies are needed to determine whether cannabis and/or alternative tobacco 
products are driving the increased toxicant exposure.
IMPLICATIONS: Cousers of cannabis and tobacco appear to be exposed to greater 
levels of harmful chemicals (ie, volatile organic compounds and polycyclic 
aromatic hydrocarbons), but similar levels of nicotine as CS. It is unclear if 
the higher levels of toxicant exposure in cousers are due to cannabis use or the 
increased use of alternative tobacco products compared with CS. It is important 
for studies examining biomarkers of exposure among CS to account for cannabis 
use as it may have a significant impact on outcomes. Additionally, further 
research is needed examining exposure to harmful chemicals among cannabis users.

INTRODUCTION: How nicotine dependence will be affected when current smokers 
initiate electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use to reduce cigarette smoking is 
unknown. This study evaluated cigarette, e-cigarette, and total nicotine 
dependence more than 6 months among smokers reducing cigarette consumption by 
replacing with e-cigarettes.
AIMS AND METHODS: Adult cigarette smokers were randomized to one of four 
conditions (36 mg/ml e-cigarette, 8 mg/ml e-cigarette, 0 mg/ml e-cigarette, or 
cigarette-substitute [CS] [provided at no cost]) and instructed to reduce their 
cigarette smoking by 75% at 1 month. Participants completed follow-up at 1, 3, 
and 6 months. The Penn State Nicotine Dependence Index (PSNDI) measured 
dependence on cigarettes (PSCDI) and e-cigarettes (PSECDI). Urine cotinine 
measured total nicotine exposure. Linear mixed effects models for each outcome 
were conducted and included interaction terms between visit and condition.
RESULTS: Participants (n = 520) were 58.8% female, 67.3% White, and 48.0 years 
old. At baseline, the median number of cigarettes smoked per day was 17.3 and 
the mean PSCDI score was 13.4, with no significant differences between 
conditions. Participants in the e-cigarette conditions reported significantly 
lower PSCDI scores, compared with baseline, and with the CS condition at all 
follow-up visits. Those in the 36 mg/ml e-cigarette condition reported greater 
PSECDI scores at 6 months, compared with baseline and the 0 mg/ml and 8 mg/ml 
conditions. At all follow-up visits, there were no differences in total nicotine 
exposure compared to baseline, nor between any conditions.
CONCLUSIONS: E-cigarette use was associated with reduced cigarette dependence, 
compared to the CS, without significant increases in total nicotine exposure.
IMPLICATIONS: Initiation of electronic cigarette use while continuing to smoke 
could potentially increase nicotine dependence. In this randomized trial aimed 
at helping smokers to reduce their cigarette intake, we found that use of an 
e-cigarette was associated with a reduction in cigarette dependence and an 
increase in e-cigarette dependence (in the condition with the highest nicotine 
concentration only), with no long term increase in total nicotine dependence or 
nicotine exposure.

BACKGROUND: Given the rapid increase in the popularity of e-cigarettes and the 
paucity of associated longitudinal health-related data, the need to assess the 
potential risks of long-term use is essential.
OBJECTIVE: To compare exposure to nicotine, tobacco-related carcinogens, and 
toxins among smokers of combustible cigarettes only, former smokers with 
long-term e-cigarette use only, former smokers with long-term nicotine 
replacement therapy (NRT) use only, long-term dual users of both combustible 
cigarettes and e-cigarettes, and long-term users of both combustible cigarettes 
and NRT.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
SETTING: United Kingdom.
PARTICIPANTS: The following 5 groups were purposively recruited: combustible 
cigarette-only users, former smokers with long-term (≥6 months) e-cigarette-only 
or NRT-only use, and long-term dual combustible cigarette-e-cigarette or 
combustible cigarette-NRT users (n = 36 to 37 per group; total n = 181).
MEASUREMENTS: Sociodemographic and smoking characteristics were assessed. 
Participants provided urine and saliva samples and were analyzed for biomarkers 
of nicotine, tobacco-specific N-nitrosamines (TSNAs), and volatile organic 
compounds (VOCs).
RESULTS: After confounders were controlled for, no clear between-group 
differences in salivary or urinary biomarkers of nicotine intake were found. The 
e-cigarette-only and NRT-only users had significantly lower metabolite levels 
for TSNAs (including the carcinogenic metabolite 
4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol [NNAL]) and VOCs (including 
metabolites of the toxins acrolein; acrylamide; acrylonitrile; 1,3-butadiene; 
and ethylene oxide) than combustible cigarette-only, dual combustible 
cigarette-e-cigarette, or dual combustible cigarette-NRT users. The 
e-cigarette-only users had significantly lower NNAL levels than all other 
groups. Combustible cigarette-only, dual combustible cigarette-NRT, and dual 
combustible cigarette-e-cigarette users had largely similar levels of TSNA and 
VOC metabolites.
LIMITATION: Cross-sectional design with self-selected sample.
CONCLUSION: Former smokers with long-term e-cigarette-only or NRT-only use may 
obtain roughly similar levels of nicotine compared with smokers of combustible 
cigarettes only, but results varied. Long-term NRT-only and e-cigarette-only 
use, but not dual use of NRTs or e-cigarettes with combustible cigarettes, is 
associated with substantially reduced levels of measured carcinogens and toxins 
relative to smoking only combustible cigarettes.

Over 40 million people use e-cigarettes worldwide, but the impact of chronic 
e-cigarette use on health has not been adequately defined. In particular, 
effects of e-cigarette aerosol inhalation on inflammation and host defenses 
across the body are not fully understood. We conducted a longitudinal cohort 
pilot study to explore changes in the inflammatory state and monocyte function 
of e-cigarette users (n = 20) versus healthy controls (n = 13) and to evaluate 
effects of e-cigarette use reduction on the same. Saliva, sputum, and blood were 
obtained from e-cigarette users at baseline and after a 2-wk intervention of 
decreased e-cigarette use. Overall, across 38 proteins quantified by multiplex, 
airway samples from e-cigarette users tended to have decreased levels of 
immunomodulatory proteins relative to healthy controls, whereas levels of 
cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors in the circulation tended to be 
elevated. Specifically, e-cigarette users had lower levels of IL-1 receptor 
antagonist (IL-1Ra) in saliva (P < 0.0001), with higher IL-1Ra and 
growth-regulated oncogene (GRO) levels in sputum (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, 
respectively), and higher levels of both TNFβ (P < 0.0001) and VEGF (P < 0.0001) 
in plasma. Circulating monocytes from e-cigarette users had alterations in their 
inflammatory phenotype in response to reduced e-cigarette use, with blunted IL-8 
and IL-6 release upon challenge with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (P < 0.001 and 
P < 0.05, respectively), suggesting a decreased ability to appropriately respond 
to bacterial infection. Based on these findings, chronic inhalation of 
e-cigarette aerosols alters the inflammatory state of the airways and systemic 
circulation, raising concern for the development of both inflammatory and 
infectious diseases in chronic users of e-cigarettes.

BACKGROUND: The short and long-term health effects of JUUL electronic cigarette 
(e-Cig) are largely unknown and warrant extensive research. We hypothesized that 
JUUL exposure could cause cerebrovascular toxicities impacting the progression 
and outcome of ischemic stroke comparable to tobacco smoke (TS) exposure.
METHODS: We exposed male C57 mice to TS/JUUL vapor for 14 days. LCMS/MS was used 
to measure brain and plasma nicotine and cotinine level. Transient middle 
cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) followed by reperfusion was used to mimic 
ischemic stroke. Plasma levels of IL-6 and thrombomodulin were assessed by 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. At the same time, western blotting was used 
to study blood-brain barrier (BBB) tight junction (TJ) proteins expression and 
key inflammatory and oxidative stress markers.
RESULTS: tMCAO upregulated IL-6 and decreased plasma thrombomodulin levels. 
Post-ischemic brain injury following tMCAO was significantly worsened by JUUL/TS 
pre-exposure. TJ proteins expression was also downregulated by JUUL/TS 
pre-exposure after tMCAO. Like TS, exposure to JUUL downregulated the expression 
of the antioxidant Nrf2. ICAM-1 was upregulated in mice subjected to tMCAO 
following pre-exposure to TS or JUUL, with a greater effect of TS than JUUL.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that JUUL exposure could negatively impact 
the cerebrovascular system, although to a lesser extent than TS exposure.

RATIONALE: Cannabidiol (CBD), a compound found in many strains of the Cannabis 
genus, is increasingly available in e-cigarette liquids as well as other 
products. CBD use has been promoted for numerous purported benefits which have 
not been rigorously assessed in preclinical studies.
OBJECTIVE: To further validate an inhalation model to assess CBD effects in the 
rat. The primary goal was to determine plasma CBD levels after vapor inhalation 
and compare that with the levels observed after injection. Secondary goals were 
to determine if hypothermia is produced in male Sprague-Dawley rats and if CBD 
affects nociception measured by the warm water tail-withdrawal assay.
METHODS: Blood samples were collected from rats exposed for 30 min to vapor 
generated by an e-cigarette device using CBD (100, 400 mg/mL in the propylene 
glycol vehicle). Separate experiments assessed the body temperature response to 
CBD in combination with nicotine (30 mg/mL) and the anti-nociceptive response to 
CBD.
RESULTS: Vapor inhalation of CBD produced concentration-related plasma CBD 
levels in male and female Wistar rats that were within the range of levels 
produced by 10 or 30 mg/kg, CBD, i.p. Dose-related hypothermia was produced by 
CBD in male Sprague-Dawley rats, and nicotine (30 mg/mL) inhalation enhanced 
this effect. CBD inhalation had no effect on anti-nociception alone or in 
combination with Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol inhalation.
CONCLUSIONS: The vapor-inhalation approach is a suitable pre-clinical model for 
the investigation of the effects of inhaled CBD. This route of administration 
produces hypothermia in rats, while i.p. injection does not, at comparable 
plasma CBD levels.

The effect of electronic cigarette (E-cig) vaping on cardiac and vascular 
function during the healing phase of myocardial infarction (MI), and post-MI 
remodeling was investigated. Sprague Dawley rats were subjected to left coronary 
artery ligation to induce MI. One week later, rats were randomized to receive 
either 12 weeks of exposure to purified air (n = 37) or E-cig vapor (15 mg/ml of 
nicotine) (n = 32). At 12 weeks, cardiac and vascular function, and post-MI 
remodeling were assessed. Baseline blood flow in the femoral artery did not 
differ between groups, but peak reperfusion blood flow was blunted in the E-cig 
group (1.59 ± 0.15 ml/min) vs. the air group (2.11 ± 0.18 ml/min; p = 0.034). 
Femoral artery diameter after reperfusion was narrower in the E-cig group 
(0.54 ± 0.02 mm) compared to the air group (0.60 ± 0.02 mm; p = 0.023). 
Postmortem left ventricular (LV) volumes were similar in the E-cig 
(0.69 ± 0.04 ml) and air groups (0.73 ± 0.04 ml; p = NS); and myocardial infarct 
expansion index did not differ between groups (1.4 ± 0.1 in E-cig group versus 
1.3 ± 0.1 in air group; p = NS). LV fractional shortening by echo did not differ 
between groups at 12 weeks (E-cig at 29 ± 2% and air at 27 ± 1%; p = NS). 
Exposure to E-cig during the healing phase of MI was associated with altered 
vascular function with reduced femoral artery blood flow and diameter at 
reperfusion, but not with worsened LV dilation or worsened cardiac function.

BACKGROUND: Electronic cigarettes (e-cigs) vaping, cigarette smoke, and 
waterpipe tobacco smoking are associated with various cardiopulmonary diseases. 
microRNAs are present in higher concentration in exosomes that play an important 
role in various physiological and pathological functions. We hypothesized that 
the non-coding RNAs transcript may serve as susceptibility to disease biomarkers 
by smoking and vaping.
METHODS: Plasma exosomes/EVs from cigarette smokers, waterpipe smokers and dual 
smokers (cigarette and waterpipe) were characterized for their size, morphology 
and TEM, Nanosight and immunoblot analysis. Exosomal RNA was used for small RNA 
library preparation and the library was quantified using the High Sensitivity 
DNA Analysis on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer system and sequenced using the 
Illumina NextSeq 500 and were converted to fastq format for mapping genes.
RESULTS: Enrichment of various non-coding RNAs that include microRNAs, tRNAs, 
piRNAs, snoRNAs, snRNAs, Mt-tRNAs, and other biotypes are shown in exosomes. A 
comprehensive differential expression analysis of miRNAs, tRNAs and piRNAs 
showed significant changes across different pairwise comparisons. The seven 
microRNAs that were common and differentially expressed of when all the smoking 
and vaping groups were compared with non-smokers (NS) are hsa-let-7a-5p, 
hsa-miR-21-5p, hsa-miR-29b-3p, hsa-let-7f-5p, hsa-miR-143-3p, hsa-miR-30a-5p and 
hsa-let-7i-5p. The e-cig vs. NS group has differentially expressed 5 microRNAs 
(hsa-miR-224-5p, hsa-miR-193b-3p, hsa-miR-30e-5p, hsa-miR-423-3p, 
hsa-miR-365a-3p, and hsa-miR-365b-3p), which are not expressed in other three 
groups. Gene set enrichment analysis of microRNAs showed significant changes in 
the top six enriched functions that consisted of biological pathway, biological 
process, molecular function, cellular component, site of expression and 
transcription factor in all the groups. Further, the pairwise comparison of 
tRNAs and piRNA in all these groups revealed significant changes in their 
expressions.
CONCLUSIONS: Plasma exosomes of cigarette smokers, waterpipe smokers, e-cig 
users and dual smokers have common differential expression of microRNAs which 
may serve to distinguish smoking and vaping subjects from NS. Among them 
has-let-7a-5p has high sensitivity and specificity to distinguish NS with the 
rest of the users, using ROC curve analysis. These findings will pave the way 
for the utilizing the potential of exosomes/miRNAs as a novel theranostic agents 
in lung injury and disease caused by tobacco smoking and vaping.

BACKGROUND: Electronic cigarettes have gained growing popularity especially 
among adolescents and young adults. Although the dominant consideration by 
consumers and the companies claims, whether electronic smoking is indeed a much 
safer alternative to traditional smoking is hotly debated.
AIM: To declare the biochemical, histopathological and ultrastructural impact of 
electronic cigarette exposure on the tissues of respiratory passage.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty adult male Wistar albino rats were allocated into 
two groups of 10 animals in each; group I as control group and group II which 
was exposed to 1 ml/day for one hour of E-liquid involving (18 mg/ml nicotine) 
for 5 sequential days/ week for 4 weeks. Assessment of markers of oxidative 
stress; malondialdehyde (MDA) & total antioxidant capacity (TAC) was performed. 
Specimens of their larynxes and lungs were subjected to histopathological 
examination with light microscopy (H&E, toluidine blue and orcein stain) with 
histopathological injury scoring, electron microscopic, histo-morphometric, and 
immune-histochemical studies of protein α-SMA, p53 and ki-67 RESULTS: E-liquid 
vapors exposed rats exhibited a significant elevation of MDA and suppression in 
TAC levels in comparison with the control group in all respiratory pathway 
organs. Microscopic analysis of respiratory epithelium of exposed group revealed 
hyperplasia, loss of their cilia and vascular dilatation in lamina propria while 
the lung examination showed thickened alveolar septa, inflammatory infiltrate 
and congested thick wall blood vessels. The bronchus was lined with multilayered 
dark stained nuclei epithelium, and there were thickened irregular smooth muscle 
fibers. Morphometric analysis revealed increase of area percent of elastic 
fibers in experimental rats' lungs. Increase of α-SMA and P53 immuno-expression 
but decrease of Ki-67 immuno-expression in exposed groups were observed when 
compared to control. Ultrastructural examination showed cilial loss in 
respiratory epithelium with shrunken type 1 & 2 alveolar cells, with cytoplasmic 
vacuolations, atypical lamellar bodies and shrunken nuclei. Significant increase 
of the score of histopathological injury in larynx and lung.
CONCLUSION: Exposure to e-liquid with nicotine induces oxidative stress and has 
adverse impact on respiratory pathway including histo-pathological and 
ultrastructural disorganization of respiratory epithelium and lung tissues.

BACKGROUND: During the use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes), users are 
still exposed to carcinogens similar to those found in tobacco products. Since 
these carcinogens are metabolized and excreted in urine, they may have 
carcinogenic effects on the bladder urinary tract epithelium. This meta-analysis 
aimed to compare bladder cancer carcinogens in the urine of tobacco users and 
e-cigarette users using a large number of samples.
METHODS: A systematic meta-analysis was performed using data obtained from 
several scientific databases (up to November 2023). This cumulative analysis was 
performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Evaluation and 
Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) and Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic 
Evaluations (AMSTAR) guidelines, according to a protocol registered with 
PROSPERO. This study was registered on PROSPERO and obtained the unique number: 
CRD42023455600.
RESULTS: The analysis included 10 high-quality studies that considered 
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and 
tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs). Statistical indicators show that there is 
a difference between the tobacco user group and the e-cigarette user group in 
terms of 1-Hydroxynaphthalene (1-NAP) [weighted mean difference (WMD)10.14, 95% 
confidence interval (CI) (8.41 to 11.88), p < 0.05], 1-Hydroxyphenanthrene 
(1-PHE) [WMD 0.08, 95% CI (-0.14 to 0.31), p > 0.05], 1-Hydroxypyrene (1-PYR) 
[WMD 0.16, 95% CI (0.12 to 0.20), p < 0.05], 2-Hydroxyfluorene (2-FLU) [WMD 
0.69, 95% CI (0.58 to 0.80), p < 0.05], 2-Hydroxynaphthalene (2-NAP) [WMD 7.48, 
95% CI (4.15 to 10.80), p < 0.05], 3-Hydroxyfluorene (3-FLU) [WMD 0.57, 95% CI 
(0.48 to 0.66), p < 0.05], 2-Carbamoylethylmercapturic acid (AAMA) [WMD 66.47, 
95% CI (27.49 to 105.46), p < 0.05], 4-Hydroxy-2-buten-1-yl-mercapturic acid 
(MHBMA) [WMD 287.79, 95% CI (-54.47 to 630.04), p > 0.05], 
4-(Methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNAL) [WMD 189.37, 95% CI (78.45 
to 300.29), p < 0.05], or N0-nitrosonornicotine (NNN) [WMD 11.66, 95% CI (7.32 
to 16.00), p < 0.05].
CONCLUSION: Urinary bladder cancer markers were significantly higher in 
traditional tobacco users than in e-cigarette users.Systematic review

BACKGROUND: Electronic cigarettes (e-cigs) were introduced as electronic 
nicotine delivery systems, and have become very popular in the USA and globally. 
There is a paucity of data on systemic injury biomarkers of vaping in e-cig 
users that can be used as a noninvasive assessment of vaping-associated lung 
injuries. We hypothesised that characterisation of systemic biomarkers of 
inflammation, anti-inflammatory, oxidative stress, vascular and lipid mediators, 
growth factors, and extracellular matrix breakdown may provide information 
regarding the toxicity of vaping in e-cig users.
METHODS: We collected various biological fluids, i.e. plasma, urine, saliva and 
exhaled breath condensate (EBC), measured pulmonary function and vaping 
characteristics, and assessed various biomarkers in e-cig users and nonusers.
RESULTS: The plasma samples of e-cig users showed a significant increase in 
biomarkers of inflammation (interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-13, interferon 
(IFN)-γ, matrix metalloproteinase-9, intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1) and 
extracellular matrix breakdown (desmosine), and decreased pro-resolving lipid 
mediators (resolvin D1 and resolvin D2). There was a significant increase in 
growth factor (endothelial growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, 
β-nerve growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor-AA, stem cell factor, 
hepatocyte growth factor and placental growth factor) levels in plasma of e-cig 
users versus nonusers. E-cig users showed a significant increase in levels of 
inflammatory biomarker IFN-γ, oxidative stress biomarker 8-isoprostane and 
oxidative DNA damage biomarker 8-oxo-dG in urine samples, and of inflammatory 
biomarker IL-1β in saliva samples. EBC showed a slight increase in levels of 
triglycerides and 8-isoprostane in e-cig users compared with normal nonusers.
CONCLUSION: E-cig users have increased levels of biomarkers of inflammation and 
oxidative stress, reduced pro-resolving anti-inflammatory mediators, and 
endothelial dysfunction, which may act as risk factors for increasing 
susceptibility to systemic diseases. The identified noninvasive biomarkers can 
be used for determining e-cig vaping-associated lung injuries, and for 
regulatory and diagnostic aspects of vaping in humans.

This study aimed to clarify the association between hypertension and 
conventional cigarette and electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use, together or 
individually. A total of 275,762 participants were included, of which 120,766 
were men and 154,996 were women. The data were drawn from the Korea Community 
Health Survey conducted in 2019. A multiple logistic regression model was used 
to examine the association between hypertension and types of smoking. 
Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure higher than 140 mmHg or 
diastolic blood pressure higher than 90 mmHg. Based on the types of smoking, 
participants were grouped as dual smokers of conventional and e-cigarettes, 
e-cigarette only smokers, conventional cigarette only smokers, past-smokers, and 
non-smokers. Compared to non-smokers, dual smokers presented the highest odds 
ratio for hypertension in the male [odds ratio (OR): 1.24, confidence interval 
(CI): 1.10 to 1.39] and female groups (OR: 1.44 CI: 0.96 to 2.15). According to 
the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test, the two-sided p-value of < 0.001 indicated an 
overall statistically significant association between types of smoking and 
hypertension. Use of both cigarette types was statistically significant in the 
male group, but only the use of conventional cigarettes and past smoking were 
statistically significant in the female group. Among smokers of the two 
cigarette types, those who were dual smokers of e-cigarettes and conventional 
cigarettes were the most likely to have the highest prevalence of hypertension.

BACKGROUND: Recent regulations have banned all flavors except menthol/mint and 
classic tobacco from pod-based e-cigarette devices such as JUUL. However, 
menthol/mint flavor can present a potential risk given its increasing popularity 
among young people in the US and its puffing and nicotine-enhancing properties. 
This study examines the impact of menthol/mint flavor manipulation on users' 
puffing behavior, subjective experience, and nicotine exposure among young 
people.
METHODS: JUUL users (n = 33, 18-24 years) attended two 60-min ad libitum 
e-cigarette use sessions (menthol/mint flavor vs. classic tobacco flavor) in a 
cross-over design. Puff topography and plasma nicotine concentration were 
measured, and participants completed subjective experience questionnaires.
RESULTS: Following the use of the menthol/mint-flavored pod, increases were 
observed in measures of satisfaction, pleasurable/interest to use, willingness 
to use again, enjoyment, urge to vape, product appeal, taste, and concentration 
(p < .05 for all). For example, compared to the classic tobacco flavor, 
participants experienced significantly more satisfaction of the product (4.24 
vs. 3.09; p = .001) and sensation enjoyment of the product (3.55 vs. 2.48; 
p = .002) when using the menthol/mint flavor. While means of the plasma nicotine 
boost and puff parameters were lower in the classic tobacco condition compared 
to the menthol/mint flavor condition, no statistical significance was observed 
between the two conditions (p > .05 for all).
CONCLUSIONS: Results of this pilot study suggest that menthol/mint-flavor 
increases e-cigarette users' subjective experience significantly. Regulating 
menthol/mint flavor is a potentially promising strategy to curb e-cigarette use 
among young people.

E-cigarettes are portrayed as safer relative to conventional tobacco. However, 
burgeoning evidence suggests that E-cigarettes may adversely affect host 
defenses. However, the precise mechanisms by which E-cigarette vapor alters 
innate immune cell function have not been fully elucidated. We determined the 
effects of E-cigarette exposure on the function and responses to infectious 
challenge of the most abundant innate immune cell, the neutrophil, using 
isolated human neutrophils and a mouse model of gram-negative infection. Our 
results revealed that human neutrophils exposed to E-cigarette vapor had 
4.2-fold reductions in chemotaxis toward the bacterial cell-well component 
f-Met-Leu-Phe (P < 0.001). F-actin polarization and membrane fluidity were also 
adversely affected by E-cigarette vapor exposure. E-cigarette-exposed human 
neutrophils exhibited a 48% reduction in production of reactive oxygen species 
(ROS; P < 0.001). Given the central role of ROS in neutrophil extracellular trap 
(NET) production, NET production was quantified, and E-cigarette vapor exposure 
was found to reduce NETosis by 3.5-fold (P < 0.01); formulations with and 
without nicotine containing propylene glycol exhibiting significant suppressive 
effects. However, noncanonical NETosis was unaffected. In addition, exposure to 
E-cigarette vapor lowered the rate of phagocytosis of bacterial bioparticles by 
47% (P < 0.05). In our physiological mouse model of chronic E-cigarette exposure 
and sepsis, E-cigarette vapor inhalation led to reduced neutrophil migration in 
infected spaces and a higher burden of Pseudomonas. These findings provide 
evidence that E-cigarette use adversely impacts the innate immune system and may 
place E-cigarette users at higher risk for dysregulated inflammatory responses 
and invasive bacterial infections.

Electronic cigarette (e-cig) use is continuing to increase, particularly among 
youth never-smokers, and is used by some smokers to quit. The acute and chronic 
toxicity of e-cig use is unclear generally in the context of increasing reports 
of inflammatory-type pneumonia in some e-cig users. To assess lung effects of 
e-cigs without nicotine or flavors, we conducted a pilot study with serial 
bronchoscopies over 4 weeks in 30 never-smokers, randomized either to a 4-week 
intervention with the use of e-cigs containing only 50% propylene glycol (PG) 
and 50% vegetable glycerine or to a no-use control group. Compliance to the 
e-cig intervention was assessed by participants sending daily puff counts and by 
urinary PG. Inflammatory cell counts and cytokines were determined in 
bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids. Genome-wide expression, miRNA, and mRNA 
were determined from bronchial epithelial cells. There were no significant 
differences in changes of BAL inflammatory cell counts or cytokines between 
baseline and follow-up, comparing the control and e-cig groups. However, in the 
intervention but not the control group, change in urinary PG as a marker of 
e-cig use and inhalation was significantly correlated with change in cell counts 
(cell concentrations, macrophages, and lymphocytes) and cytokines (IL8, IL13, 
and TNFα), although the absolute magnitude of changes was small. There were no 
significant changes in mRNA or miRNA gene expression. Although limited by study 
size and duration, this is the first experimental demonstration of an impact of 
e-cig use on inflammation in the human lung among never-smokers.

Whole Salivary Cotinine Levels and Interleukin 1-β Levels among Young Adults 
Involuntarily Exposed to Vapor from Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems.

AlMubarak AM, Alqutub MN, Javed F, Vohra F, Abduljabbar T.

PURPOSE: To the assess whole salivary cotinine and interleukin 1β (IL-1β) levels 
among individuals involuntarily exposed to vapor from electronic nicotine 
delivery systems (ENDS) (test group) and unexposed individuals (control group).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Demographic data and information related to ENDS vapor 
exposure were collected using a questionnaire. Unstimulated whole saliva samples 
were collected, unstimulated whole-saliva flow rate (UWSFR) was calculated, and 
cotinine and IL-1β levels were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay. Sample-size estimation and statistical analysis were performed. 
Regression analysis was performed to determine the correlation between whole 
salivary cotinine and IL-1β levels. Statistical significance was set at p < 
0.05.
RESULTS: Forty-eight individuals (24 and 24 in test and control groups, 
respectively) were included. Mean ages of individuals in the test and control 
groups were comparable. In the test group, the mean duration for which the 
individuals inhaled vapor from ENDS in each session was 22.3 ± 9.5 min and they 
were exposed to ENDS vapor 12.2 ± 2.4 times daily. There was no difference in 
the UWSFR between patients in the test (0.21 ± 0.02 ml/min) and control (0.22 ± 
0.04 ml/min) groups. Whole salivary cotinine (p < 0.001) and IL-1β (p < 0.001) 
levels were significantly higher in the test than control group.
CONCLUSION: Young adults involuntarily exposed to vapor from ENDS express 
﻿elevated whole salivary cotinine and IL-1β levels. Long-term exposure to ENDS 
vapor may potentially predispose vulnerable populations to oral and systemic 
inflammatory diseases.

The aim of this study was to estimate changes in selected physicochemical 
properties of saliva collected from users of electronic cigarettes. Methods: The 
study population consisted of 120 patients (40 users of electronic cigarettes, 
40 smokers of traditional cigarettes and 40 non-smokers). Laboratory tests 
included verification of saliva amount of lysozyme, lactoferrin and IgA. 
Results: Among e-cigarette users, statistically significant differences were 
observed in values of lysozyme and lactoferrin; however, no statistically 
significant differences for the IgA value were found. In the group of 
traditional cigarette smokers, statistically significant differences were 
observed among all tested parameters in relation to the control group. In 
relation to IgA, statistically significant differences were found between 
e-cigarette users and traditional cigarette smokers, to the disadvantage of the 
latter. Conclusion: Saliva of e-cigarette users showed changes of antibacterial 
properties in comparison to the control group and traditional cigarette smokers. 
Further longitudinal studies on larger study groups should be conducted in order 
to assess the effect of observed changes in the antibacterial properties of 
saliva on oral health.

OBJECTIVES: To determine if urinary biomarkers of effect and potential harm are 
elevated in electronic cigarette users compared with non-smokers and if 
elevation correlates with increased concentrations of metals in urine.
STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: This was a cross-sectional study of biomarkers of 
exposure, effect and potential harm in urine from non-smokers (n=20), electronic 
cigarette users (n=20) and cigarette smokers (n=13). Participant's screening and 
urine collection were performed at the Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, 
and biomarker analysis and metal analysis were performed at the University of 
California, Riverside.
RESULTS: Metallothionein was significantly elevated in the electronic cigarette 
group (3761±3932 pg/mg) compared with the non-smokers (1129±1294 pg/mg, p=0.05). 
8-OHdG (8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine) was significantly elevated in electronic 
cigarette users (442.8±300.7 ng/mg) versus non-smokers (221.6±157.8 ng/mg, 
p=0.01). 8-Isoprostane showed a significant increase in electronic cigarette 
users (750.8±433 pg/mg) versus non-smokers (411.2±287.4 pg/mg, p=0.03). Linear 
regression analysis in the electronic cigarette group showed a significant 
correlation between cotinine and total metal concentration; total metal 
concentration and metallothionein; cotinine and oxidative DNA damage; and total 
metal concentration and oxidative DNA damage. Zinc was significantly elevated in 
the electronic cigarette users (584.5±826.6 µg/g) compared with non-smokers 
(413.6±233.7 µg/g, p=0.03). Linear regression analysis showed a significant 
correlation between urinary zinc concentration and 8-OHdG in the electronic 
cigarette users.
CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to investigate biomarkers of potential harm 
and effect in electronic cigarette users and to show a linkage to metal 
exposure. The biomarker levels in electronic cigarette users were similar to 
(and not lower than) cigarette smokers. In electronic cigarette users, there was 
a link to elevated total metal exposure and oxidative DNA damage. Specifically, 
our results demonstrate that zinc concentration was correlated to oxidative DNA 
damage.

BACKGROUND: Little is known about the behavioral effects of non-nicotine 
ingredients in electronic cigarette liquids. Propylene glycol (PG) and vegetable 
glycerin (VG) are the most common humectants used in electronic cigarette 
liquids. These ingredients may influence stimulus effects (e.g., visibility of 
exhalant, taste, or smell), which have played a role in the abuse liability of 
conventional cigarettes. In the current study, the stimulus effects of aerosol 
from liquids varying only in PG and VG content were assessed.
METHODS: Sixteen electronic cigarette users completed five sessions (one 
practice and four testing sessions). Following one hour of nicotine deprivation, 
two sampling puffs from liquid formulations containing 100/0, 75/25, 50/50, 
25/75, and 0/100% PG/VG concentrations were administered in random order during 
five assessments, each separated by 20 min. Measures included self-reported 
stimulus effects and breakpoint on a multiple-choice procedure with options 
consisting of sampled puffs or varying amounts of money.
RESULTS: VG content was associated with greater reports of visibility of the 
exhalant (i.e., "cloud"). Liquids with only PG or VG engendered lower reports of 
inhalation sensations (e.g., throat hit) and greater reductions of systolic 
blood pressure compared to mixtures of PG and VG. There was no effect of liquid 
formulation on the multiple-choice procedure, but puffs were rarely chosen over 
even the smallest monetary option ($0.05), suggesting minimal reinforcing 
efficacy.
CONCLUSIONS: Liquids containing greater concentrations of VG are more capable of 
producing visible exhalant and mixtures of PG and VG engender greater airway 
sensory effects than either ingredient alone.

Electronic cigarettes (E-cigarettes) use is an emerging public health problem. 
Trying to assess the independent associations between E-cigarettes use and whole 
blood cell in a nationally representative sample of the US adults is very 
important for the smoking population. Using E-cigarettes data from NHANES 
(National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) 2013-2018, 17,180 adults were 
included in this cross-sectional analysis. All participants were stratified into 
four different groups (non-smoke group N=10087, E-cigarettes group N=52, 
dual-smoke group N=249, cigarettes group N=6792) based on questions SMQ020 
(smoked at least 100 cigarettes in life) and SMQ690H (used last 5 days 
E-cigarettes). Whole blood cell tests included white blood cell (WBC) with 
differentials, red blood cell (RBC) with characteristics, and platelet 
variables. With adjusted by age, gender, and race ethnicity, multivariate 
logistic regression analyses were used to assess independent associations 
between E-cigarettes group and other groups for different whole blood cell 
variables. A total of 17,180 participants were included in the study; 47.9% were 
males, with a mean age of 46.99 (±0.29). In WBC-related variables, non-smoke 
group had the lowest value in WBC counts (7.15±0.05), lymphocyte (2.15±0.02), 
and monocyte (0.57±0.01), among the four different groups. In RBC-related 
variables, non-smoke group had the lowest value in mean cell volume (MCV, 
88.46±0.14, p<0.05) and mean cell hemoglobin (MCH, 29.73±0.06, p<0.05), among 
the four different groups. In adjusted analysis, WBC (OR = 0.97, 95% CI: 
0.96-0.98, p<0.001), especially lymphocyte (OR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.96-0.98, 
p<0.001) and monocyte (OR = 0.11, 95% CI: 0.02-0.66, p<0.001) of non-smoke 
group, showed negative significant effect for E-cigarettes group. Meanwhile, 
lower odds of MCV (OR = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.81-1.04, p<0.05) and MCH (OR = 0.81, 95% 
CI: 0.65-1.00, p<0.05) in non-smoke group were observed compared to E-cigarettes 
group. Conversely, for dual-smoke group and cigarette group, there was no 
significant results in all whole blood cell variables compared to E-cigarettes 
group. E-cigarettes use might be associated with a systemic response that could 
lead to an increase in WBC, especially lymphocytes and monocytes, in the US 
adults. Meanwhile, the properties of RBC might also be influenced 
simultaneously; MCV and MCH in E-cigarettes population were bigger than the 
non-smoke population.

OBJECTIVES: JUUL and earlier generation electronic cigarettes (e-cigs) are 
promoted as being less hazardous than cigarettes. While JUUL Labs, in 
particular, claims that switching from smoking to vaping has beneficial impacts, 
the health effects of such products are not well understood. We investigated 
whether exposure to JUUL and previous generation e-cig aerosol impairs 
endothelial function comparably to cigarette smoke.
METHODS: We exposed rats to aerosol from Virginia Tobacco flavor JUUL, an e-cig 
tank system using unflavored freebase nicotine e-liquid, Marlboro Red 
combustible tobacco cigarettes, or clean air for 10 cycles of 2 second 
inhalation over 5 minutes. Endothelial function (FMD) was measured pre- and 
post-exposure. Blood was collected 20 mins post-exposure for serum nicotine 
analysis.
RESULTS: Aerosol/smoke from JUUL, previous generation e-cigs, and cigarettes all 
impaired FMD. The extent of impairment ranged from 34%-58%, although the 
differences between groups were insignificant. Nicotine was highest in serum 
from the JUUL group; for the other e-cig and cigarette groups, nicotine levels 
were lower and comparable to each other.
CONCLUSIONS: Aerosol from JUUL and previous generation e-cigs impairs 
endothelial function in rats, comparable to impairment by cigarette smoke.

Update of
    Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2016 Sep 14;9:CD010216.

BACKGROUND: Electronic cigarettes (ECs) are handheld electronic vaping devices 
which produce an aerosol formed by heating an e-liquid. People who smoke report 
using ECs to stop or reduce smoking, but some organisations, advocacy groups and 
policymakers have discouraged this, citing lack of evidence of efficacy and 
safety. People who smoke, healthcare providers and regulators want to know if 
ECs can help people quit and if they are safe to use for this purpose. This 
review is an update of a review first published in 2014.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect and safety of using electronic cigarettes 
(ECs) to help people who smoke achieve long-term smoking abstinence.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's Specialized 
Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, 
Embase, and PsycINFO for relevant records to January 2020, together with 
reference-checking and contact with study authors.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 
randomized cross-over trials in which people who smoke were randomized to an EC 
or control condition. We also included uncontrolled intervention studies in 
which all participants received an EC intervention. To be included, studies had 
to report abstinence from cigarettes at six months or longer and/or data on 
adverse events (AEs) or other markers of safety at one week or longer.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We followed standard Cochrane methods for 
screening and data extraction. Our primary outcome measures were abstinence from 
smoking after at least six months follow-up, AEs, and serious adverse events 
(SAEs). Secondary outcomes included changes in carbon monoxide, blood pressure, 
heart rate, blood oxygen saturation, lung function, and levels of known 
carcinogens/toxicants. We used a fixed-effect Mantel-Haenszel model to calculate 
the risk ratio (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous 
outcomes. For continuous outcomes, we calculated mean differences. Where 
appropriate, we pooled data from these studies in meta-analyses.
MAIN RESULTS: We include 50 completed studies, representing 12,430 participants, 
of which 26 are RCTs. Thirty-five of the 50 included studies are new to this 
review update. Of the included studies, we rated four (all which contribute to 
our main comparisons) at low risk of bias overall, 37 at high risk overall 
(including the 24 non-randomized studies), and the remainder at unclear risk. 
There was moderate-certainty evidence, limited by imprecision, that quit rates 
were higher in people randomized to nicotine EC than in those randomized to 
nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) (risk ratio (RR) 1.69, 95% confidence 
interval (CI) 1.25 to 2.27; I2 = 0%; 3 studies, 1498 participants). In absolute 
terms, this might translate to an additional four successful quitters per 100 
(95% CI 2 to 8). There was low-certainty evidence (limited by very serious 
imprecision) of no difference in the rate of adverse events (AEs) (RR 0.98, 95% 
CI 0.80 to 1.19; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 485 participants). SAEs occurred rarely, 
with no evidence that their frequency differed between nicotine EC and NRT, but 
very serious imprecision led to low certainty in this finding (RR 1.37, 95% CI 
0.77 to 2.41: I2 = n/a; 2 studies, 727 participants). There was 
moderate-certainty evidence, again limited by imprecision, that quit rates were 
higher in people randomized to nicotine EC than to non-nicotine EC (RR 1.71, 95% 
CI 1.00 to 2.92; I2 = 0%; 3 studies, 802 participants). In absolute terms, this 
might again lead to an additional four successful quitters per 100 (95% CI 0 to 
12). These trials used EC with relatively low nicotine delivery. There was 
low-certainty evidence, limited by very serious imprecision, that there was no 
difference in the rate of AEs between these groups (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.73 to 
1.36; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 346 participants). There was insufficient evidence to 
determine whether rates of SAEs differed between groups, due to very serious 
imprecision (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.19; I2 = n/a; 4 studies, 494 
participants). Compared to behavioural support only/no support, quit rates were 
higher for participants randomized to nicotine EC (RR 2.50, 95% CI 1.24 to 5.04; 
I2 = 0%; 4 studies, 2312 participants). In absolute terms this represents an 
increase of six per 100 (95% CI 1 to 14). However, this finding was very 
low-certainty, due to issues with imprecision and risk of bias. There was no 
evidence that the rate of SAEs varied, but some evidence that non-serious AEs 
were more common in people randomized to nicotine EC (AEs: RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.04 
to 1.31; I2 = 28%; 3 studies, 516 participants; SAEs: RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.25 to 
6.96; I2 = 17%; 5 studies, 842 participants). Data from non-randomized studies 
were consistent with RCT data. The most commonly reported AEs were throat/mouth 
irritation, headache, cough, and nausea, which tended to dissipate over time 
with continued use. Very few studies reported data on other outcomes or 
comparisons and hence evidence for these is limited, with confidence intervals 
often encompassing clinically significant harm and benefit.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is moderate-certainty evidence that ECs with 
nicotine increase quit rates compared to ECs without nicotine and compared to 
NRT. Evidence comparing nicotine EC with usual care/no treatment also suggests 
benefit, but is less certain. More studies are needed to confirm the degree of 
effect, particularly when using modern EC products. Confidence intervals were 
wide for data on AEs, SAEs and other safety markers. Overall incidence of SAEs 
was low across all study arms. We did not detect any clear evidence of harm from 
nicotine EC, but longest follow-up was two years and the overall number of 
studies was small. The main limitation of the evidence base remains imprecision 
due to the small number of RCTs, often with low event rates. Further RCTs are 
underway. To ensure the review continues to provide up-to-date information for 
decision-makers, this review is now a living systematic review. We will run 
searches monthly from December 2020, with the review updated as relevant new 
evidence becomes available. Please refer to the Cochrane Database of Systematic 
Reviews for the review's current status.

Knowledge about the change in blood nicotine concentrations during the first 
five minutes (acute phase) of e-cigarette vaping is important to determine 
whether the used product has a dependence potential or may be an efficient 
nicotine replacement product. To address this issue, we monitored blood nicotine 
levels during the acute phase in volunteers using disposable cigalikes (CLs) and 
a tank model (TM) and compared them with blood nicotine levels in subjects using 
a tobacco cigarette (TC). In parallel, heart rate changes were continually 
measured and withdrawal symptoms and craving were assessed with the 
Questionnaire on Smoking Urges before and immediately after the vaping/smoking 
sessions. Additionally, at the end of each session negative health effects were 
rated on a visual analog scale. After five minutes of e-cigarette or TC use, the 
mean nicotine plasma concentrations were as follows: CLs, 5.5ng/ml; TM, 
9.3ng/ml; TC, 17.1ng/ml. Nicotine levels increased significantly faster in the 
first 4min of consuming a TC than with the CLs and the TM. The highest rate of 
increase in nicotine concentration was found with the TC (6.8ng/ml) and TM 
(2.3ng/ml) between the 1st and 2nd minute, whereas the CLs showed comparatively 
small changes in the amount delivered over the five minutes. Withdrawal and 
craving for smoking decreased with the TM by the same amount as with the TC, 
even though less nicotine was delivered to the blood and considerably fewer side 
effects occurred. The heart rate of TM users was also markedly lower than that 
of the TC users. Unlike CLs, TM e-cigarettes represent an effective source of 
nicotine and might be used as an alternative nicotine replacement product to aid 
smoking cessation. However, nicotine plasma levels observed in TM users after 
short-time vaping have also the potential to produce and sustain nicotine 
addiction.

The aim was to compare the clinical (plaque index [PI], bleeding on probing 
[BOP], probing pocket depth [PPD] and clinical attachment loss [CAL]) and 
radiographic (marginal bone loss [MBL]) periodontal parameters and whole 
salivary cotinine, interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6 levels among cigarette-smokers, 
waterpipe-smokers, E-cig users and never-smokers. In total, 154 male individuals 
(39 cigarette-smokers, 40 waterpipe-smokers, 37 E-cig users and 38 
never-smokers) were included. Full mouth PI, BOP, PPD and CAL were measured on 
all teeth (excluding third molars); and MBL was measured in digital intra-oral 
radiographs. Unstimulated whole salivary flow rate (UWSFR) and whole salivary 
cotinine, IL-1β and IL-6 levels were measured. Group comparisons were performed 
using one way analysis of variance and Bonferroni post-hoc tests. P-values less 
than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. There was no difference in 
UWSFR among the groups. Cotinine levels were significantly higher among 
cigarette- (P < 0.001) and waterpipe-smokers (P < 0.001) and E-cig users 
(P < 0.001) than never-smokers. IL-1β (P < 0.01) and IL-6 (P < 0.01) levels were 
significantly higher among cigarette- and waterpipe-smokers than E-cig users and 
never-smokers. There was no difference in PPD, CAL, mesial and distal MBL and 
whole salivary IL-1β and IL-6 levels among E-cig users and never-smokers. In 
conclusion, clinical and radiographic parameters of periodontal inflammation 
were poorer in cigarette and waterpipe smokers than E-cig users and 
never-smokers; and whole salivary cotinine levels were similar in all groups. 
Whole salivary IL-1β and IL-6 levels were higher in cigarette- and 
waterpipe-smokers than E-cig users and never-smokers.

This works aimed to assess the health risks of e-cigarette use to bystanders. 
The exhaled breath of 17 volunteers was collected while they were vaping, and 
the levels of nicotine, propylene glycol, glycerol, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, 
acrolein, tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs), and heavy metals were analyzed. 
Increased levels of nicotine, propylene glycol, TSNAs and copper were found in 
the exhaled breath of the volunteers. From these measurements, bystander 
exposure was estimated for two different scenarios: (1) A non-ventilated car 
with two e-cigarette users and (2) a ventilated office with one e-cigarette 
user. Our results show that bystanders may experience irritation of the 
respiratory tract as a result of exposure to propylene glycol and glycerol. 
Systemic effects of nicotine should also be expected if nicotine-containing 
e-liquid is used, including palpitations, and an increase of the systolic blood 
pressure. Furthermore, due to the presence of TSNAs in some e-liquids, an 
increased risk of tumors could not be excluded for the 'car' scenario. While 
e-cigarette use can clearly have effects on the health of bystanders, the risks 
depend on the rate of ventilation, dimensions of the room, and vaping behavior 
of the e-cigarette user. The presence of TSNAs in e-liquids can be avoided, 
which will prevent the most serious effect identified (increased risk of 
tumors).

California, San Francisco, CA, USA.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Relative pharmacological effects of e-cigarettes and 
cigarettes during 24 hours of ad-libitum use have not been described. In this 
study, 24-hour blood plasma nicotine concentrations and 48-hour subjective 
effects with use of cigarettes and e-cigarettes were measured among dual users.
DESIGN: Two-arm within-subject cross-over design with preferred e-cigarette or 
cigarette ad-libitum use over 48 hours.
SETTING: Hospital research ward in San Francisco, California, USA.
PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-six healthy dual users of e-cigarettes and cigarettes 
(n = 8, 25% females).
MEASUREMENTS: Twenty-four-hour blood plasma nicotine and cotinine concentrations 
and 48-hour self-reported nicotine withdrawal symptoms and rewarding effects.
FINDINGS: Analyses used analysis of variance (ANOVA)-based mixed models with 
order of product (e-cigarette or cigarette) and product type (combustible 
cigarette or type of e-cigarette) as fixed effects, and subject as a repeated 
effect. During a 24-hour period, e-cigarettes produced lower nicotine exposure 
than cigarettes for the majority of users, although 25% received more nicotine 
from e-cigarettes, which was predicted by more frequent e-cigarette use or 
greater dependence. Compared to cigarette smoking, nicotine exposure for 
variable-power tank users was similar, while cig-a-like (t(30)  = 2.71, 
P = 0.011, d = 0.745) and fixed-power tank users (t(30)  = 3.37, P = 0.002, 
d = 0.993) were exposed to less nicotine. Cigarettes were rated higher than 
e-cigarettes on some desirable subjective effects (e.g. psychological reward, 
t(322)  = 7.24 P < 0.001, d = 0.432), but withdrawal symptom reduction was 
comparable. No differences were found between e-cigarette types, but Bayes 
factors indicate that these measures were insensitive.
CONCLUSIONS: During a 24-hour period in a hospital setting in the United States, 
nicotine exposure for dual users of e-cigarettes and cigarettes was similar when 
using cigarettes or variable-power tank devices only but was lower for those 
using cig-a-like or fixed-power devices only. Despite lower nicotine levels, all 
types of e-cigarette were effective in preventing withdrawal symptoms. 
E-cigarettes were rated less rewarding than cigarettes.

INTRODUCTION: Concurrent use of tobacco cigarettes and e-cigarettes ("dual use") 
is common among tobacco users. Little is known about differences in demographics 
and toxicant exposure among subsets of dual users.
AIMS AND METHODS: We analyzed data from adult dual users (current every/some day 
users of tobacco cigarettes and e-cigarettes, n = 792) included in the PATH 
Study Wave 1 (2013-2014) and provided urine samples. Samples were analyzed for 
biomarkers of exposure to nicotine and selected toxicants (tobacco-specific 
nitrosamine NNK [NNAL], lead, cadmium, naphthalene [2-naphthol], pyrene 
[1-hydroxypyrene], acrylonitrile [CYMA], acrolein [CEMA], and acrylamide 
[AAMA]). Subsets of dual users were compared on demographic, behavioral, and 
biomarker measures to exclusive cigarette smokers (n = 2411) and exclusive 
e-cigarette users (n = 247).
RESULTS: Most dual users were predominant cigarette smokers (70%), followed by 
daily dual users (13%), non-daily concurrent dual users (10%), and predominant 
vapers (7%). Dual users who smoked daily showed significantly higher biomarker 
concentrations compared with those who did not smoke daily. Patterns of 
e-cigarette use had little effect on toxicant exposure. Dual users with high 
toxicant exposure were generally older, female, and smoked more cigarettes per 
day. Dual users who had low levels of biomarkers of exposure were generally 
younger, male, and smoked non-daily.
CONCLUSIONS: In 2013-2014, most dual users smoked cigarettes daily and used 
e-cigarettes occasionally. Cigarette smoking appears to be the primary driver of 
toxicant exposure among dual users, with little-to-no effect of e-cigarette use 
on biomarker levels. Results reinforce the need for dual users to stop smoking 
tobacco cigarettes to reduce toxicant exposure.
IMPLICATIONS: With considerable dual use of tobacco cigarettes and e-cigarettes 
in the United States, it is important to understand differences in toxicant 
exposure among subsets of dual users, and how these differences align with user 
demographics. Findings suggest most dual users smoke daily and use e-cigarettes 
intermittently. Low exposure to toxicants was most common among younger users, 
males, and intermittent smokers; high exposure to toxicants was most common 
among older users, females, and heavier cigarette smokers. Results underscore 
the heterogeneity occurring within dual users, and the need to quit smoking 
cigarettes completely in order to reduce toxicant exposure.

INTRODUCTION: The aerosol composition of electronic cigarettes (ECs) suggests 
that exposure to toxicants during use is greatly reduced compared to exposure 
from combustible cigarettes (CCs).
METHODS: This randomized, parallel-group, clinical study enrolled smokers to 
switch to Vuse Solo (VS) Digital Vapor Cigarettes (Original or Menthol) or 
Nicorette 4 mg nicotine gum (NG) in a controlled setting. Subjects who smoked 
CCs ad libitum for 2 days during a baseline period were then randomized to ad 
libitum use of either VS or NG for 5 days. Biomarkers of 23 toxicants were 
measured in 24-hour urine samples and blood collected at baseline and following 
product switch.
RESULTS: A total of 153 subjects completed the study. Total nicotine equivalents 
decreased in all groups, but higher levels were observed in the VS groups 
compared to the NG groups, with decreases of 38% and 60%-67%, respectively. All 
other biomarkers were significantly decreased in subjects switched to VS, and 
the magnitude of biomarker decreases was similar to subjects switched to NG. 
Decreases ranged from 30% to greater than 85% for constituents such as benzene 
and acrylonitrile.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that exposure to toxicants when using VS is 
significantly reduced compared to CC smoking, and these reductions are similar 
to those observed with use of NG. Although statistically significantly 
decreased, nicotine exposure is maintained closer to CC smoking with VS use 
compared to NG use. This research suggests that use of VS exposes consumers to 
fewer and lower levels of smoke toxicants than CCs while still providing 
nicotine to the consumer.
IMPLICATIONS: This is the first study to report changes in nicotine delivery and 
biomarkers of tobacco exposure following a short-term product switch from CCs to 
either an EC or NG in a controlled environment. The study shows that nicotine 
exposure decreased in both groups but was maintained closer to CC smoking with 
the EC groups. Biomarkers of tobacco combustion decreased to similar levels in 
both EC and gum groups.

BACKGROUND: A rapidly evolving tobacco marketplace highlights the timeliness of 
the FDA's authority to regulate tobacco, specifically the role that flavorings 
in nicotine-containing electronic cigarette (ECIG) liquids have on public 
health. This study aimed to evaluate the extent to which ECIG liquid flavor and 
nicotine concentration influenced subjective measures of abuse liability among 
young adult cigarette (cig) smokers.
METHODS: Young adult (18-21 y.o.) smokers (M = 10.1 cig/day, no regular ECIG use 
history) completed 7 Latin-square ordered conditions each preceded by 12 h. 
nicotine/tobacco abstinence. Conditions were own brand cig (OB) and eGo-style 
ECIG paired with three liquid flavors (cream, tropical fruit, tobacco/menthol) 
varying in nicotine concentration (0 or 36 mg/ml). Products were administered in 
two 10-puff bouts in each condition. Heart rate/blood pressure (HR/BP) and 
tobacco/nicotine abstinence symptoms, nicotine/general drug effects, and 
acceptability measures were assessed repeatedly throughout sessions. Mixed 
linear models were followed-up with Tukey's HSD t-tests.
RESULTS: HR/BP indicated nicotine exposure during nicotine-containing 
conditions. OB and tobacco/menthol 36 mg/ml conditions produced significant 
decreases in ratings of cig smoking urges. Nicotine/drug effects were elevated 
significantly for OB and 36 mg/ml ECIG conditions with one exception noted for 
the tobacco/menthol 0 mg/ml condition. OB had the highest acceptability ratings, 
and ECIG condition results varied by acceptability item.
CONCLUSIONS: Among young adult smokers, ECIG conditions containing nicotine were 
positively associated with several subjective measures of abuse liability but 
not all. Flavors did not consistently mask/enhance effects observed. Results 
reinforce continued examination of ECIG-delivered nicotine and liquid flavors in 
relationship to abuse liability.

[Clozapine and the electronic cigarette; a case study].

[Article in Dutch]

Nonner TS, Timmer SJ.

Electronic cigarettes are becoming increasingly popular and therefore 
psychiatrists are being confronted more and more frequently by this relatively 
new phenomenon. We discuss the case of a patient who switched from traditional 
cigarettes to electronic cigarettes and thereupon had a significant increase in 
the clozapine serum level. The increased level led to considerable side-effects 
and, as a result, the patients clozapine dosage had to be reduced. In theory, a 
rise in the clozapine serum level is to be expected after such a switch. 
However, since electronic cigarettes have not been on the market for very long, 
psychiatrists need to be aware of the risks and dangers that can arise as a

The aim of this study was to identify whether or not the dual users of 
conventional cigarettes and e-cigs were naturally reducing the amount of their 
cigarette smoking while they were using e-cigs, and whether their urine cotinine 
level became similar or less compared to conventional cigarette-only smokers. We 
used data from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
(KNHANES), a nationally representative sample collected in 2014-2016. We 
selected 2,442 participants who were over 19 years old and were current users of 
conventional cigarettes and e-cigs. Among the total sample, 12.8% were dual 
users of e-cigs and conventional cigarettes. Conventional cigarette-only users 
smoked 14.26 (±23.19) cigarettes a day, while dual users of electronic and 
conventional cigarettes smoked 14.46 (±7.88) cigarettes a day (p < .001). Means 
of urine cotinine level in conventional cigarette-only users and dual users were 
1250.35 ng/mL (±832.75) and 1364.95 ng/mL (±827.96), respectively (p < .001). 
The result of a multiple linear regression analysis identified that dual users' 
cotinine level was 136.80 ng/mL higher, compared to conventional cigarette 
smokers' one (p = .011). Unlike the argument that e-cigs can be used as a 
smoking cessation aid, we found that using e-cigs might be less likely to 
support quitting smoking or reducing cigarette consumption.

Quantification of exposure to different chemicals from both combustible 
cigarettes and vaping products is important in providing information on the 
potential health risks of these products. To assess the exposure to tobacco 
products, biomarkers of exposure (BOEs) are measured in a variety of biological 
matrices. In this review paper, current knowledge on analytical methods applied 
to the analysis of biomarkers of exposure to tobacco products is discussed. 
Numerous sample preparation techniques are available for the extraction and 
sample clean up for the analysis of BOEs to tobacco and nicotine delivery 
products. Many tobacco products-related exposure biomarkers have been analyzed 
using different instrumental techniques, the most common techniques being gas 
and liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS, GC-MS/MS and 
LC-MS/MS). To assess exposure to emerging tobacco products and study exposure in 
dual tobacco users, the list of biomarkers analyzed in urine samples has been 
expanded. Therefore, the current state of the literature can be used in 
preparing a preferred list of biomarkers based on the aim of each study. The 
information summarized in this review is expected to be a handy tool for 
researchers involved in studying exposures to tobacco products, as well as in 
risk assessment of biomarkers of exposure to vaping products.

Electronic cigarettes (E-cigarettes) are being widely used, and growing in 
popularity. It is estimated that more than 9 million adults use them regularly. 
The potential adverse health effects of electronic cigarette vapor (E-vapor) 
exposure are poorly defined. While several animal models of E-vapor exposure 
have been developed, few models expose rodents to clinically relevant quantities 
of nicotine and make direct comparisons to cigarette smoke within the same 
exposure system. Here, we present a method for constructing and operating an 
E-vapor chamber and cigarette smoke chamber. The chambers are constructed by 
outfitting anesthesia chambers with a computer controlled pumping system that 
delivers consistent amounts of E-vapor or cigarette smoke to rodents. Nicotine 
exposure is measured indirectly by quantifying pre and post-exposure serum 
cotinine levels. This exposure system can be modified to accommodate various 
types of E-cigarettes and tobacco cigarettes, and can be used to compare the 
effects of E-vapor and cigarette smoke in vivo.

The increasing popularity of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) as an 
alternative to conventional tobacco products has raised concerns regarding their 
potential adverse effects. The cardiovascular system undergoes intricate 
processes forming the heart and blood vessels during fetal development. However, 
the precise impact of e-cigarette smoke and aerosols on these delicate 
developmental processes remains elusive. Previous studies have revealed changes 
in gene expression patterns, disruptions in cellular signaling pathways, and 
increased oxidative stress resulting from e-cigarette exposure. These findings 
indicate the potential for e-cigarettes to cause developmental and 
cardiovascular harm. This comprehensive review article discusses various aspects 
of electronic cigarette use, emphasizing the relevance of cardiovascular studies 
in Zebrafish for understanding the risks to human health. It also highlights 
novel experimental approaches and technologies while addressing their inherent 
challenges and limitations.

Electronic cigarette use is highest among adults of child-bearing age. Many 
parents that use electronic cigarettes believe that secondhand exposure of 
electronic cigarette vapors for their children is not dangerous and is less 
harmful than secondhand exposure to traditional cigarette smoke. These beliefs 
may prompt excessive secondhand exposure to electronic cigarette vapors for 
their children. Little research has been done to document exposure in children. 
The traditional biological method of exposure detection is through a blood draw, 
which is difficult and undesirable in children. The purpose of this study was to 
assess the feasibility of using saliva and exhaled breath condensate as 
non-invasive biomatrices for detecting secondhand electronic cigarette vapor 
exposure in children. In this cross-sectionally designed study, we recruited 22 
children exposed to electronic cigarette vapors and 26 non-exposed between the 
ages of 4-12 years. We compared metabolic features across three biomatrices, 
blood, saliva, and exhaled breath condensate. We noted moderate to strong 
pairwise, sample-specific, and feature-specific adjusted correlations. Annotated 
features associated with direct and secondhand electronic cigarette exposure 
were noted. These results demonstrate that less invasive biomatrices may be used 
to detect features associated with secondhand electronic cigarette vapor 
exposure in children.

This publication introduces a series of eight other publications describing the 
non-clinical assessment and initial clinical study of a candidate modified risk 
tobacco product (MRTP) - the Tobacco Heating System 2.2 (THS2.2). This paper 
presents background information on tobacco harm reduction, to complement the 
approaches aimed at increasing smoking cessation and reducing smoking initiation 
to reduce the morbidity and mortality caused by cigarette smoking. THS2.2 heats 
tobacco without combustion, and the resulting formation of harmful and 
potentially harmful constituents (HPHC) is greatly reduced compared with 
cigarette smoke. Assessment of the THS2.2 aerosol in vitro and in vivo reveals 
reduced toxicity and no new hazards. Additional mechanistic endpoints, measured 
as part of in vivo studies, confirmed reduced impact on smoking-related disease 
networks. The clinical study confirmed the reduced exposure to HPHCs in smokers 
switching to THS2.2, and the associated transcriptomic study confirmed the 
utility of a gene expression signature, consisting of only 11 genes tested in 
the blood transcriptome of subjects enrolled in the clinical study, as a 
complementary measure of exposure response. The potential of THS2.2 as an MRTP 
is demonstrated by the assessment and additional publications cited in this 
series.

Monitoring nicotine intake from e-cigarettes: measurement of parent drug and 
metabolites in oral fluid and plasma.

Papaseit E, Farré M, Graziano S, Pacifici R, Pérez-Mañá C, García-Algar O, 
Pichini S.

BACKGROUND: Electronic cigarettes (e-cig) known as electronic nicotine devices 
recently gained popularity among smokers. Despite many studies investigating 
their safety and toxicity, few examined the delivery of e-cig-derived nicotine 
and its metabolites in alternative biological fluids.
METHODS: We performed a randomized, crossover, and controlled clinical trial in 
nine healthy smokers. Nicotine (NIC), cotinine (COT), and 
trans-3'-hydroxycotinine (3-HCOT) were measured in plasma and oral fluid by 
liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry after consumption of two 
consecutive e-cig administrations or two consecutive tobacco cigarettes.
RESULTS: NIC and its metabolites were detected both in oral fluid and plasma 
following both administration conditions. Concentrations in oral fluid resulted 
various orders of magnitude higher than those observed in plasma. Oral fluid 
concentration of tobacco cigarette and e-cig-derived NIC peaked at 15 min after 
each administration and ranged between 1.0 and 1396 μg/L and from 0.3 to 860 
μg/L; those of COT between 52.8 and 110 μg/L and from 33.8 to 94.7 μg/L; and 
those of 3-HCOT between 12.4 and 23.5 μg/L and from 8.5 to 24.4 μg/L. The oral 
fluid to plasma concentration ratio of both e-cig- and tobacco cigarette-derived 
NIC peaked at 15 min after both administrations and correlated with oral fluid 
NIC concentration.
CONCLUSIONS: The obtained results support the measurement of NIC and metabolites 
in oral fluid in the assessment of intake after e-cig use and appear to be a 
suitable alternative to plasma when monitoring nicotine delivery from e-cig for 
clinical and toxicological studies.

INTRODUCTION: Evidence suggests that cigarette smokers who switch to electronic 
nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) reduce their exposure to harmful toxicants and 
carcinogens. It is unclear if dual-use is associated with decreases in exposure 
to toxicants.
METHODS: This parallel-group confinement study assessed changes in biomarkers of 
exposure (BOEs) over six days among healthy adult smokers who were randomized 
into 1 of 11 study groups: eight JUUL-brand System (JUUL) groups (4 JUUL flavors 
[Virginia Tobacco, Menthol, Mint, Mango] × 2 nicotine concentrations [5.0% or 
3.0% by weight]); Dual-Use group used preferred JUUL flavor (5.0% nicotine) and 
≤50% usual brand (UB) cigarettes/day; UB Cigarette group and one group abstained 
from all tobacco/nicotine product use (Abstinence group). Urine and blood 
analysis assessed changes in primary BOE endpoints (NNAL, 3-HPMA, MHBMA, S-PMA 
COHb) and secondary BOE endpoints (NNN, HMPMA, CEMA, 1-OHP, O-toluidine, 2-NA, 
4-ABP) among 279 adult smokers.
RESULTS: In JUUL groups, median percent reductions in primary BOEs (Day 
6-Baseline) were 90%-≥100% of Abstinence; there were no significant differences 
between JUUL groups and Abstinence. All reductions in JUUL groups were 
substantially and statistically significantly greater than reductions in the UB 
Cigarette group (ps < 0.025). Median reductions in primary BOEs in the Dual-Use 
group were 43%-55% of Abstinence. Similar results were observed for secondary 
BOEs.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the use of JUUL as a complete or partial 
substitute (i.e., dual-use with ≥50% reduction in cigarette consumption) for 
combustible cigarettes can substantially reduce exposure to multiple toxins 
associated with cigarette smoking.
IMPLICATIONS: This study adds to the growing body of evidence supporting the 
utility of ENDS products as potentially reduced-harm alternatives to cigarettes 
for adult smokers. Adult smokers who switched completely from cigarette smoking 
to use of the JUUL System ("JUUL") in two nicotine concentrations (5.0% and 
3.0%) and four flavors significantly reduced their exposure to multiple classes 
of cigarette-related toxicants. Additionally, smokers who used JUUL and 
continued smoking but reduced their daily cigarette consumption by ≥50% (dual 
users) also significantly reduced their toxicant exposure compared to cigarette 
smoking.

In spite of the widespread use of electronic cigarettes, also known as 
e-cigarettes, and the proposed adverse cardiac effects of nicotine, the 
detrimental effects of e-cigarettes on the heart are not well known. This study 
examines the detrimental effects of e-cigarettes with nicotine at doses that 
yield circulating nicotine and cotinine in the ranges similar to the levels 
found in habitual smokers, and a high fat diet (HFD) on cardiac structure and 
function in a commonly used model of diet-induced obesity (DIO). C57BL/6J mice 
on an HFD were exposed to e-cigarette in the presence (2.4% nicotine) or absence 
(0% nicotine) of nicotine and saline aerosol for 12 weeks. Echocardiographic 
data demonstrated a decrease in left ventricular (LV) fractional shortening, LV 
ejection fraction, and velocity of circumferential fiber shortening (VCF) in 
mice treated with e-cigarette (2.4% nicotine) compared to e-cigarette (0% 
nicotine) or saline exposed mice. Cardiomyocytes (CMs) of mice treated with 
e-cigarette (2.4% nicotine) exhibited LV abnormalities, including lipid 
accumulation (ventricular steatosis), myofibrillar derangement and destruction, 
and mitochondrial hypertrophy, as revealed by transmission electron microscopy. 
The detrimental effects of e-cigarettes (2.4% nicotine) on cardiac structure and 
function was accompanied by increased oxidative stress, plasma free fatty acid 
levels, CM apoptosis, and inactivation of AMP-activated protein kinase and 
activation of its downstream target, acetyl-CoA-carboxylase. Our results 
indicate profound adverse effects of e-cigarettes (2.4% nicotine) on the heart 
in obese mice and raise questions about the safety of the nicotine e-cigarettes 
use.

INTRODUCTION: There is no standardized aerosol exposure apparatus to deliver 
heated tobacco products (HTPs) for in vivo experiments. Therefore, we developed 
a novel HTPs aerosol exposure apparatus for mice and demonstrated that nicotine 
and other chemicals in HTPs aerosol generated by the apparatus can be delivered 
to mice which replicate human smoke.
AIMS AND METHODS: The amounts of nicotine, tar, and carbon monoxide (CO) in IQOS 
(Marlboro Regular HeatSticks) aerosol generated by two types of apparatuses were 
determined. C57BL/6N mice were exposed to IQOS aerosol, followed by 
determination of the urinary nicotine metabolites. Further, the skin surface 
temperature of mice was monitored to confirm the vasoconstriction action of 
nicotine.
RESULTS: The amount of chemicals in IQOS aerosol by the novel air push-in 
inhalation apparatus for HTPs (APIA) was equivalent to that of the analytical 
vaping machine (LM4E) (1.60 ± 0.08 [APIA] vs. 1.46 ± 0.07 mg/stick [LM4E] in 
nicotine and 0.55 ± 0.04 [APIA] vs. 0.45 ± 0.01 mg/stick [LM4E] in CO). After 
mice were exposed to IQOS aerosol by APIA, the urinary nicotine metabolite 
levels were determined; peak values in cotinine and 3-hydroxycotinine (3-HC) 
were 6.82 μg/mg creatinine at 1 hour after exposure and 32.9 μg/mg creatinine at 
2 hours after exposure, respectively. The skin surface temperature decreased and 
was lower (33.5°C ± 0.5°C) at 30 minutes than before exposure (37.6°C ± 0.8°C).
CONCLUSIONS: The new apparatus for HTPs aerosol exposure to mice showed good 
performances in terms of both chemical analysis of collected aerosol and 
fluctuations in the urinary nicotine metabolites.
IMPLICATIONS: The APIA reported in this study can expose small animals to HTPs 
aerosol, including nicotine and other chemical substances as same amounts as 
LM4E and replicate actual human smoking process by in vivo experiments. 
Therefore, the experiments using APIA can provide evidence to assess the health 
risks of HTPs use.

Comparisons of systemic exposure to toxicants during monitored cigarette 
smoking, electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use, and abstention are needed to 
enhance our understanding of the risks of e-cigarette use (vaping). In a 
cross-over study, we measured 10 mercapturic acid metabolites of volatile 
organic compounds (VOCs) in 24-hour urine samples collected from 36 dual users 
(8 women) of e-cigarettes and cigarettes during 2 days of ad libitum vaping or 
cigarette-only use, and 2 days of enforced abstention. Concentrations of VOC 
metabolites were higher during smoking compared with vaping, except for the 
methylating agents' metabolite. The fold-difference in concentrations when 
smoking relative to vaping ranged from 1.31 (1.06-1.61; geometric mean, 95% 
confidence interval; 1,3-butadiene) to 7.09 (5.88-8.54; acrylonitrile). 
Metabolites of acrylamide [fold difference of 1.21 (1.03-1.43)] and benzene 
[1.46 (1.13-1.90)] were higher during vaping compared with abstention. The 
1,3-butadiene and propylene oxide metabolites were higher in variable-power tank 
users compared with users of cig-a-likes. E-cigarettes expose users to lower 
levels of toxic VOCs compared with cigarette smoking, supporting their harm 
reduction potential among smokers. However, some e-cigarettes expose users to 
VOCs such as acrylamide, benzene, and propylene oxide, and may pose health risks 
to nonsmoking users. The results of our study will inform regulators in 
assessing e-cigarettes with respect to the balance between its potential harm 
reduction for adult smokers and risk to nonsmoking users.

INTRODUCTION: Simple silicone wristbands (WB) hold promise for exposure 
assessment in children. We previously reported strong correlations between 
nicotine in WB worn by children and urinary cotinine (UC). Here, we investigated 
differences in WB chemical concentrations among children exposed to secondhand 
smoke from conventional cigarettes (CC) or secondhand vapor from electronic 
cigarettes (EC), and children living with nonusers of either product (NS).
METHODS: Children (n = 53) wore three WB and a passive nicotine air sampler for 
7 days and one WB for 2 days, and gave a urine sample on day 7. Caregivers 
reported daily exposures during the 7-day period. We determined nicotine, 
cotinine, and tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs) concentrations in WB, 
nicotine in air samplers, and UC through isotope-dilution liquid chromatography 
with triple-quadrupole mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: Nicotine and cotinine levels in WB in children differentiated between 
groups of children recruited into NS, EC exposed, and CC exposed groups in a 
similar manner to UC. WB levels were significantly higher in the CC group (WB 
nicotine median 233.8 ng/g silicone, UC median 3.6 ng/mL, n = 15) than the EC 
group (WB nicotine median: 28.9 ng/g, UC 0.5 ng/mL, n = 19), and both CC and EC 
group levels were higher than the NS group (WB nicotine median: 3.7 ng/g, UC 0.1 
ng/mL, n = 19). TSNAs, including the known carcinogen NNK, were detected in 39% 
of WB.
CONCLUSIONS: Silicone WB show promise for sensitive detection of exposure to 
tobacco-related contaminants from traditional and electronic cigarettes and have 
potential for tobacco control efforts.
IMPLICATIONS: Silicone WB worn by children can absorb nicotine, cotinine, and 
tobacco-specific nitrosamines, and amounts of these compounds are closely 
related to the child's urinary cotinine. Levels of tobacco-specific compounds in 
the silicone WB can distinguish patterns of children's exposure to secondhand 
smoke and e-cigarette vapor. Silicone WB are simple to use and acceptable to 
children and, therefore, may be useful for tobacco control activities such as 
parental awareness and behavior change, and effects of smoke-free policy 
implementation.

INTRODUCTION: Long-term health effects of e-vapor products (EVPs) are not 
well-established. We compared biomarkers of exposure (BoE) to select harmful and 
potentially harmful constituents and biomarkers of potential harm (BoPH) in 
adult smokers who switched to EVPs versus continued smoking for 24 weeks.
METHODS: Adult smokers (n = 450, >10 cigarettes per day for ≥10 years) were 
randomly assigned to continue smoking (control) or switch to one of two 
cartridge-based EVPs (test 1: classic; test 2: menthol, 4% nicotine). BoE and 
BoPH were measured at baseline and 12 weeks. The results presented here are from 
a subset of 150 control and EVP subjects (switchers with exhaled carbon monoxide 
<8 ppm and <10% baseline cigarettes per day) followed for 24 total weeks.
RESULTS: Total 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol and 
carboxyhemoglobin were significantly reduced (p < .0001) in tests 1 and 2 at 24 
weeks. Urinary nicotine equivalents were not statistically significantly 
different between the control and EVP groups. At week 24, statistically 
significant reductions (p < .05) were observed for white blood cell counts, 
11-dehydrothromboxane β2, and sICAM in both test groups, and there were several 
significant changes in measures of pulmonary function. High-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol and 8-epi-prostaglandin-F2α were directionally favorable in both EVP 
groups versus control.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that significant reductions of selected harmful and 
potentially harmful constituents in EVP aerosol results in significant 
reductions in BoEs and favorable changes in BoPHs after switching to EVPs for 24 
weeks. These changes approached those reported for smoking cessation, suggesting 
that switching to exclusive use of the EVPs may be less harmful than continuing 
smoking.
IMPLICATIONS: Cigarette smoking causes serious diseases. Switching from 
cigarettes to a noncombustible product is a potential harm reduction pathway for 
adult smokers unable or unwilling to quit. Long-term health effects of e-vapor 
products (EVPs) compared with continued smoking have not been extensively 
studied. We present biomarker of exposure evidence on select harmful and 
potentially harmful constituents and biomarkers of potential harm related to 
inflammation and oxidative stress in adult smokers switching to two EVPs. This 
study demonstrates significant reductions in biomarkers of exposure (except for 
nicotine) accompanied with favorable changes in various biomarkers of potential 
harm, including pulmonary function. The totality of evidence suggests that 
exclusive EVP use may present lower health risks compared with smoking 
cigarettes.

OBJECTIVE: The popularity of electronic cigarettes (E-Cigs) smoking is 
increasing worldwide including patients with asthma. In this study, the effects 
of E-Cigs aerosol exposure on airway inflammation in an allergen-driven murine 
model of asthma were investigated.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Balb/c mice were randomly assigned to; control group 
(received fresh air, Ovalbumin (Ova) sensitization and saline challenge), E-Cig 
group (received E-Cig aerosol, Ova sensitization, and saline challenge), Ova S/C 
group (received fresh air, Ova sensitization and Ova challenge) and E-Cig + Ova 
S/C group. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue were evaluated 
for inflammatory cells and inflammatory mediators, respectively.
RESULTS: Exposure to E-Cig aerosol significantly increased the number of all 
types of inflammatory cells in BALF (p < 0.05). Further, E-Cig aerosol reduced 
levels of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 and matrix metalloproteinase 
(MMP)-2 in lung tissue homogenate (p < 0.05). Combined E-Cig aerosol and Ova S/C 
increased the airway recruitment of inflammatory cells, especially neutrophils, 
eosinophils, and lymphocytes (p < 0.05), increased the level of interleukin 
(IL)-13, and reduced the level of TGF-β1 (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: E-Cig aerosol exposure induced airway inflammation in both control 
mice and allergen-driven murine model of asthma. The inflammatory response 
induced by E-Cig was slightly higher in allergen-driven murine model of asthma 
than in healthy animals.

INTRODUCTION: Switching to noncombustible tobacco products presents an 
opportunity for cigarette smokers to potentially reduce the health risks 
associated with smoking. Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) are one 
such product because the vapor produced from ENDS contains far fewer toxicants 
than cigarette smoke. To investigate the biochemical effects of switching from 
smoking to an ENDS, we assessed global metabolomic profiles of smokers in a 
7-day confinement clinical study.
METHODS: In the first 2 days of this clinical study, the subjects used their 
usual brand of cigarettes and then switched to exclusive ENDS ad libitum use for 
5 days. Urine and plasma samples were collected at baseline and 5 days after 
switching. The samples were analyzed using a mass spectrometry-based metabolomic 
platform.
RESULTS: Random forest analyses of urine and plasma metabolomic data revealed 
excellent predictive accuracy (>97%) of a 30-metabolite signature that can 
differentiate smokers from 5-day ENDS switchers. In these signatures, most 
biomarkers are nicotine-derived metabolites or xenobiotics. They were 
significantly reduced in urine and plasma, suggesting a decreased xenobiotic 
load on subjects. Our results also show significantly decreased levels of plasma 
glutathione metabolites after switching, which suggests reduced levels of 
oxidative stress. In addition, increased urinary and plasma levels of vitamins 
and antioxidants were identified, suggesting enhanced bioavailability due to 
discontinuation of cigarette smoking and switching to Vuse ENDS use.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest reduced toxicant exposure, reduced oxidative 
stress, and potential beneficial changes in vitamin metabolism within 5 days in 
smokers switching to Vuse ENDS.
IMPLICATIONS: Switching from smoking to exclusive ENDS use in clinical 
confinement settings results in significant reduction of nicotine metabolites 
and other cigarette-related xenobiotics in urine and plasma of subjects. 
Significantly decreased oxidative stress-related metabolites and increased 
urinary and plasma levels of vitamin metabolites and antioxidants in 5-day 
short-term ENDS switchers suggest less toxic physiological environment for 
consumers of ENDS products and potential health benefits if such changes 
persist.

Smoking is a significant risk factor for the development of metabolic diseases. 
Due to social pressures to quit smoking, many pregnant women are vaping as an 
alternative nicotine source. However, the metabolic consequences of replacing 
tobacco cigarettes with e-cigarettes during pregnancy are unknown. Therefore, in 
the mothers and their offspring, we investigated the metabolic and hepatic 
impacts of replacing cigarette smoke with e-vapour during pregnancy. Female 
BALB/c mice were either air-exposed or cigarette smoke-exposed (SE) from six 
weeks before pregnancy until lactation. At mating, a subset of the SE mice were 
instead exposed to e-vapour. Markers of glucose and lipid metabolism were 
measured in the livers and plasma, from the mothers and their male offspring (13 
weeks). In the SE mothers, plasma insulin levels were reduced, leading to 
downstream increases in hepatic gluconeogenesis and plasma non-esterified fatty 
acids (NEFA). In the e-vapour replacement mothers, these changes were not as 
significant. In the SE offspring, there was impaired glucose tolerance, and 
increased plasma NEFA and liver triglyceride concentrations. E-vapour 
replacement restored lipid homeostasis but did not improve glucose tolerance. 
Therefore, in a murine model, low dose e-cigarette replacement during pregnancy 
is less toxic than cigarette smoke.

Studies in both humans and animal models demonstrated that chronic 
alcohol/e-cigarette (e-Cig) exposure affects mitochondrial function and impairs 
barrier function in brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMVECs). 
Identification of the signaling pathways by which chronic alcohol/e-Cig exposure 
induces mitochondrial damage in BMVEC is vital for protection of the blood-brain 
barrier (BBB). To address the issue, we treated human BMVEC [hBMVECs (D3 
cell-line)] with ethanol (ETH) [100 mM], acetaldehyde (ALD) [100 μM], or 
e-cigarette (e-Cig) [35 ng/mL of 1.8% or 0% nicotine] conditioned medium and 
showed reduced mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) measured by a 
Seahorse analyzer. Seahorse data were further complemented with the expression 
of mitochondrial OXPHOS proteins detected by Western blots. We also observed 
cytosolic escape of ATP and its extracellular release due to the disruption of 
mitochondrial membrane potential caused by ETH, ALD, or 1.8% e-Cig exposure. 
Moreover ETH, ALD, or 1.8% e-Cig treatment resulted in elevated purinergic P2X7r 
and TRPV1 channel gene expression, measured using qPCR. We also demonstrated the 
protective role of P2X7r antagonist A804598 (10 μM) in restoring mitochondrial 
oxidative phosphorylation levels and preventing extracellular ATP release. In a 
BBB functional assay using trans-endothelial electrical resistance, we showed 
that blocking the P2X7r channel enhanced barrier function. In summary, we 
identified the potential common pathways of mitochondrial injury caused by ETH, 
ALD, and 1.8% e-Cig which allow new protective interventions. We are further 
investigating the potential link between P2X7 regulatory pathways and 
mitochondrial health.

Cigarette smoking is a major preventable cause of morbidity and mortality. While 
quitting smoking is the best option, switching from cigarettes to 
non-combustible alternatives (NCAs) such as e-vapor products is a viable harm 
reduction approach for smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke. A key 
challenge for the clinical assessment of NCAs is that self-reported product use 
can be unreliable, compromising the proper evaluation of their risk reduction 
potential. In this cross-sectional study of 205 healthy volunteers, we combined 
comprehensive exposure characterization with in-depth multi-omics profiling to 
compare effects across four study groups: cigarette smokers (CS), e-vapor users 
(EV), former smokers (FS), and never smokers (NS). Multi-omics analyses included 
metabolomics, transcriptomics, DNA methylomics, proteomics, and lipidomics. 
Comparison of the molecular effects between CS and NS recapitulated several 
previous observations, such as increased inflammatory markers in CS. Generally, 
FS and EV demonstrated intermediate molecular effects between the NS and CS 
groups. Stratification of the FS and EV by combustion exposure markers suggested 
that this position on the spectrum between CS and NS was partially driven by 
non-compliance/dual use. Overall, this study highlights the importance of 
in-depth exposure characterization before biological effect characterization for 
any NCA assessment study.

Electronic cigarettes (E-cig) use is increasing rapidly, particularly among 
youths. Animal models for E-cig exposure with pharmacokinetics resembling human 
E-cig users are lacking. We developed an E-cig aerosol exposure system for 
rodents and a chronic intermittent delivery method that simulates E-cig users 
who vape episodically during wakefulness and abstain during sleep. Mice were 
exposed to E-cig in a programmed schedule at very low, low, medium, or high 
doses defined by duration of each puff, number of puffs per delivery episode and 
frequency of episodes in the dark phase of a 12/12-h circadian cycle for 9 
consecutive days. The plasma nicotine/cotinine levels and their time courses 
were determined using LC/MS-MS. We assessed the body weight, food intake and 
locomotor activity of Apolipoprotein E null (ApoE-/-) mice exposed to chronic 
intermittent E-cig aerosol. Plasma nicotine and cotinine levels were positively 
correlated with exposure doses. Nicotine and cotinine levels showed a circadian 
variation as they increased with time up to the maximum nicotine level of 
21.8 ± 7.1 ng/mL during the daily intermittent E-cig exposure in the 12-h dark 
phase and then declined during the light phase when there was no E-cig delivery. 
Chronic E-cig exposure to ApoE-/- mice decreased body weight, food intake and 
increased locomotion. Our rodent E-cig exposure system and chronic intermittent 
exposure method yield clinically relevant nicotine pharmacokinetics associated 
with behavioral and metabolic changes. The methodologies are essential tools for 
in vivo studies of the health impacts of E-cig exposure on CNS, cardiovascular, 
pulmonary, hepatic systems, metabolism and carcinogenesis.

Most human Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) use is via inhalation, and yet few 
animal studies of inhalation exposure are available. Popularization of 
non-combusted methods for the inhalation of psychoactive drugs (Volcano(®), 
e-cigarettes) further stimulates a need for rodent models of this route of 
administration. This study was designed to develop and validate a rodent chamber 
suitable for controlled exposure to vaporized THC in a propylene glycol vehicle, 
using an e-cigarette delivery system adapted to standard size, sealed rat 
housing chambers. The in vivo efficacy of inhaled THC was validated using 
radiotelemetry to assess body temperature and locomotor responses, a tail-flick 
assay for nociception and plasma analysis to verify exposure levels. Hypothermic 
responses to inhaled THC in male rats depended on the duration of exposure and 
the concentration of THC in the vehicle. The temperature nadir was reached after 
∼40 min of exposure, was of comparable magnitude (∼3 °Celsius) to that produced 
by 20 mg/kg THC, i.p. and resolved within 3 h (compared with a 6 h time course 
following i.p. THC). Female rats were more sensitive to hypothermic effects of 
30 min of lower-dose THC inhalation. Male rat tail-flick latency was increased 
by THC vapor inhalation; this effect was blocked by SR141716 pretreatment. The 
plasma THC concentration after 30 min of inhalation was similar to that produced 
by 10 mg/kg THC i.p. This approach is flexible, robust and effective for use in 
laboratory rats and will be of increasing utility as users continue to adopt 
"vaping" for the administration of cannabis.

INTRODUCTION: Novel nicotine delivery systems represent an evolving part of the 
tobacco harm reduction strategy. The pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of nicotine 
delivered by P3L, a pulmonary nicotine delivery system, and its effects on 
smoking urges and craving relief in relation to Nicorette inhalator were 
evaluated.
METHODS: This open-label, ascending nicotine levels study was conducted in 16 
healthy smokers. Three different nicotine delivery levels, 50, 80, and 150 
µg/puff, delivered by the P3L system were evaluated consecutively on different 
days after the use of the Nicorette inhalator. Venous nicotine PK, subjective 
effects, and tolerability were assessed.
RESULTS: Geometric least-squares means for maximum plasma nicotine concentration 
(Cmax), generated by the mixed-effect model for exposure comparison, were 9.7, 
11.2, and 9.8 ng/mL for the 50, 80, and 150 µg/puff P3L variants, respectively, 
compared to 6.1 ng/mL after Nicorette inhalator use. Median time from product 
use start to Cmax was 7.0 minutes for all P3L, compared to 30.0 minutes for the 
Nicorette inhalator. Craving reduction was slightly faster than with the 
Nicorette inhalator as assessed with the visual analog scale craving score. The 
mean Questionnaire of Smoking Urges -brief total scores did not differ for both 
products. P3L was well tolerated.
CONCLUSIONS: At all three nicotine levels tested, the inhalation of the nicotine 
lactate aerosol delivered with the P3L provided plasma nicotine concentrations 
higher and faster compared to the Nicorette inhalator. The plasma nicotine 
concentration-time profile supports a pulmonary route of absorption for P3L 
compared to the oromucosal absorption of the Nicorette inhalator.
IMPLICATIONS: The combination of nicotine and lactic acid with the P3L device 
shows potential over existing nicotine delivery systems by delivering nicotine 
with kinetics close to published data on conventional cigarettes and without 
exogenous carrier substances as used in current electronic nicotine delivery 
systems. Altogether, the PK profile, subjective effects, and safety profile 
obtained in this study suggest P3L is an innovative nicotine delivery product 
that will be acceptable to adult smokers as an alternative to cigarettes.

The introduction of electronic cigarettes has led to widespread discussion on 
the cardiovascular risks compared to conventional smoking. We therefore 
conducted a randomized cross-over study of the acute use of three tobacco 
products, including a control group using a nicotine-free liquid. Fifteen active 
smokers were studied during and after smoking either a cigarette or an 
electronic cigarette with or without nicotine (eGo-T CE4 vaporizer). Subjects 
were blinded to the nicotine content of the electronic cigarette and were 
followed up for 2 hours after smoking a cigarette or vaping an electronic 
cigarette. Peripheral and central blood pressures as well as parameters of 
arterial stiffness were measured by a Mobil-O-Graph® device. The peripheral 
systolic blood pressure rose significantly for approximately 45 minutes after 
vaping nicotine-containing liquid ( p<0.05) and for approximately 15 minutes 
after smoking a conventional cigarette ( p<0.01), whereas nicotine-free liquids 
did not lead to significant changes during the first hour of follow-up. 
Likewise, heart rate remained elevated approximately 45 minutes after vaping an 
electronic cigarette with nicotine-containing liquid and over the first 30 
minutes after smoking a cigarette in contrast to controls. Elevation of pulse 
wave velocity was independent from mean arterial pressure as well as heart rate 
in the electronic cigarette and cigarette groups. In this first of its kind 
trial, we observed changes in peripheral and central blood pressure and also in 
pulse wave velocity after smoking a cigarette as well as after vaping a 
nicotine-containing electronic cigarette. These findings may be associated with 
an increased long-term cardiovascular risk.

OBJECTIVES: The present study evaluated the association of electronic cigarette 
(EC) exposure with serum uric acid (UA) level and hyperuricemia (HUA) using a 
nationally representative sample of South Korea.
METHODS: This study included 10,692 participants (9,905, 609, and 178, never, 
ever, and current EC users, respectively). Urinary cotinine and 
4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL) levels were used to 
determine conventional smoking exposure among EC users. The association between 
EC use and UA level was evaluated by linear regression analysis. Multivariable 
logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association between EC and 
HUA. Subgroup analysis confined to cotinine-verified active smokers was 
performed to address the association between the dual use of EC and combustible 
cigarettes and serum UA levels.
RESULTS: The serum UA level was highest among current EC users, followed by ever 
and never EC users. The prevalence of HUA was 26.2%, 19.3%, and 10.8% in 
current, ever, and never EC users, respectively. Although EC exposure was 
positively associated with HUA in a dose-dependent manner only in men (Ptrend = 
0.04), a similar tendency was also observed in women with marginal significance 
(Ptrend = 0.102). The positive association of HUA with EC exposure was more 
apparent among dual users (odds ratio [OR] = 1.96, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 
1.29-2.99) than among those who only smoked combustible cigarettes.
CONCLUSIONS: EC exposure was associated with higher serum UA level and higher OR 
of HUA. The positive association between EC exposure and HUA was more prominent 
in dual users who concurrently consumed EC and combustible cigarettes.

Carcinogen and toxicant uptake by e-cigarette users have not been fully 
evaluated. In the study reported here, we recruited 30 e-cigarette users, 63 
nonsmokers, and 33 cigarette smokers who gave monthly urine samples over a 
period of 4-6 months. Their product use status was confirmed by measurements of 
exhaled CO, urinary total nicotine equivalents, cyanoethyl mercapturic acid 
(CEMA), and total 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol. Urinary 
biomarkers of exposure to the carcinogens acrolein (3-hydroxypropyl mercapturic 
acid, 3-HPMA), benzene (S-phenyl mercapturic acid, SPMA), acrylonitrile (CEMA), 
and a combination of crotonaldehyde, methyl vinyl ketone, and methacrolein 
(3-hydroxy-1-methylpropyl mercapturic acid, HMPMA) were quantified at each 
visit. Data from subject visits with CEMA > 27 pmol/mL were excluded from the 
statistical analysis of the results because of possible unreported exposures to 
volatile combustion products such as secondhand cigarette smoke or marijuana 
smoke exposure; this left 22 e-cigarette users with 4 or more monthly visits and 
all 63 nonsmokers. Geometric mean levels of 3-HPMA (1249 versus 679.3 pmol/mL 
urine) were significantly higher (P = 0.003) in e-cigarette users than in 
nonsmokers, whereas levels of SPMA, CEMA, and HMPMA did not differ between these 
two groups. All analytes were significantly higher in cigarette smokers than in 
either e-cigarette users or nonsmokers. The results of this unique multimonth 
longitudinal study demonstrate consistent significantly higher uptake of the 
carcinogen acrolein in e-cigarette users versus nonsmokers, presenting a warning 
signal regarding e-cigarette use.

This study aimed to compare Korean smokers' smoking-related biomarker levels by 
tobacco product type, including heat-not-burn cigarettes (HNBC), liquid 
e-cigarettes (EC), and traditional cigarettes (TC). Nicotine dependence levels 
were evaluated in Korean adult study participants including TC-, EC-, HNBC-only 
users and nonsmokers (n = 1586) from March 2019 to July 2019 in Seoul and 
Cheonan/Asan South Korea using the Fagerström Test Score. Additionally, urine 
samples (n = 832) were collected for the measurement of urinary nicotine, 
cotinine, OH-cotinine, NNAL(4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol), 
CYMA(N-acetyl-S-(2-cyanoehtyl)-L-cysteine), or CEMA (2-cyanoethylmercapturic 
acid) using LC-MS/MS. The median(interquartile range) nicotine dependence level 
was not different among the three types of smokers, being 3.0 (2.0-5.0) for TC- 
(n = 726), 3.0 (1.0-4.0) for EC- (n = 316), and 3.0 (2.0-4.0) for HNBC- (n = 
377) only users. HNBC-only users presented similar biomarker levels compared to 
TC-only users, except for NNAL (HNBC: 14.5 (4.0-58.8) pg/mL, TC: 32.0 (4.0-69.6) 
pg/mL; p = 0.0106) and CEMA (HNBC: 60.4 (10.0-232.0) ng/mL, TC: 166.1 
(25.3-532.1) ng/mL; p = 0.0007). TC and HNBC users showed increased urinary 
cotinine levels as early as the time after the first smoke of the day. EC users' 
biomarker levels were possibly lower than TC or HNBC users' but higher than 
those of non-smokers.

or Electronic Cigarette Exposure.

Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA.

INTRODUCTION: Documenting factors that influence differential sensitivity to 
acutely inhaled nicotine products requires carefully controlling the amount of 
exposure (dose), and thus a procedure by which to control such exposure.
METHODS: We evaluated consistency of puff volume from intermittent acute 
exposures to smoked tobacco cigarettes (study 1, n = 45, plus a comparison study 
of uninstructed use with n = 59) and to vaped electronic cigarettes 
(e-cigarettes; study 2, n = 27 naive to e-cigarettes) in adult-dependent 
smokers. All in primary studies 1 and 2 participated in research administering 
different nicotine levels in each product under blind conditions, one per 
session using within-subject designs. In both studies, participants followed an 
automated instructional procedure on a computer monitor standardizing the timing 
and amount of exposure to each product during a given trial, with four trials 
per session, each separated by 20 minutes. Puff volume per trial via Clinical 
Research Support System (CReSS) was the primary dependent measure to determine 
consistency across trials via intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs).
RESULTS: Control over topography with both inhaled products was demonstrated by 
highly significant ICCs for puff volume across trials. Instructed control with 
own brand was generally better in study 1 than with uninstructed smoking in the 
comparison sample, as expected. As intended, reliability of puff volume 
generally did not differ by menthol preference or sex in either study, but ICCs 
in study 2 tended to be lower for some men using the placebo e-cigarette.
CONCLUSIONS: This instructional procedure may substantially improve control over 
amounts of acute exposure to tobacco or e-cigarette use.
IMPLICATIONS: Control over topography in studies of acute exposure to these 
inhaled products can potentially aid validity of research into differential 
sensitivity to use, so findings can be attributed to factors of interest and not 
to variable exposure. Our procedure minimized variability in exposure to the 
same product and between moderate nicotine products, but remaining differences 
suggest that compensation for very low or no nicotine commercial products may be 
difficult to totally eliminate with these instructions alone. Further study is 
needed to determine this procedure's utility with other inhaled products among 
experienced users and when comparing different products in between-groups 
analyses.

Nicotine from inhaled combustible cigarette smoke is delivered rapidly to the 
brain, and sufficient unbound nicotine concentrations exert pharmacological 
effects. In addition to nicotine, combustible cigarette smoke also contains a 
significant number of toxicants that trigger perturbations, leading to an 
altered steady state due to differential expression of proteins. In this study, 
a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for inhaled nicotine was 
used to simulate the influence of lysosomal change-driven tissue retention and 
plasma protein binding levels on nicotine pharmacokinetics (PK). A 3 × increase 
in tissue lysosomal volumes lowered the nicotine brain maximum concentration 
(Cmax) by 20.8%. Similarly, a 50% increase in plasma protein binding also 
lowered the unbound plasma arterial nicotine Cmax by 39.4%. Such fundamental 
changes in nicotine disposition due to physiological changes in combustible 
cigarette smokers will lead to altered nicotine consumption and 
exposure-responses of other weakly basic drugs. Literature reports indicate that 
nicotine consumed from non-combustible products do not alter drug exposures, 
indicating fewer or less severe toxicant-driven perturbations with the use of 
these products. Although several other parameters influence nicotine PK, this 
PBPK modeling study shows that increased tissue retention and plasma protein 
binding reduce nicotine delivery to the brain and could lead to differential 
consumption of combustible cigarettes. These differences in physiological states 
among combustible cigarette smokers need to be evaluated and should be 
considered during therapeutic interventions.

BACKGROUND: Former smokers who currently use e-cigarettes have lower 
concentrations of biomarkers of tobacco toxicant exposure than current smokers. 
It is unclear whether tobacco toxicant exposure reductions may lead to health 
risk reductions.
METHODS: We compared inflammatory biomarkers (high-sensitivity C-reactive 
protein, IL6, fibrinogen, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1) and an 
oxidative stress marker (F2-isoprostane) among 3,712 adult participants in Wave 
1 (2013-2014) of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health Study by 
tobacco user groups: dual users of cigarettes and e-cigarettes; former smokers 
who currently use e-cigarettes-only; current cigarette-only smokers; former 
smokers who do not currently use any tobacco; and never tobacco users. We 
calculated geometric means (GM) and estimated adjusted GM ratios (GMR).
RESULTS: Dual users experienced greater concentration of F2-isoprostane than 
current cigarette-only smokers [GMR 1.09 (95% confidence interval, CI, 
1.03-1.15)]. Biomarkers were similar between former smokers who currently use 
e-cigarettes and both former smokers who do not use any tobacco and never 
tobacco users, but among these groups most biomarkers were lower than those of 
current cigarette-only smokers. The concentration of F2-isoprostane decreased by 
time since smoking cessation among both exclusive e-cigarette users (P trend = 
0.03) and former smokers who do not currently use any tobacco (P trend = 
0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Dual users have greater concentration of F2-isoprostane than 
smokers. Exclusive e-cigarette users have biomarker concentrations that are 
similar to those of former smokers who do not currently use tobacco, and lower 
than those of exclusive cigarette smokers.
IMPACT: This study contributes to an understanding of the health effects of 
e-cigarettes.

BACKGROUND: Nickel (Ni) and chromium (Cr) are components of e-cigarette heating 
coils. Whether e-cigarettes increase metal internal dose, however, is unknown. 
We assessed the association of e-cigarette use patterns and of e-liquid and 
aerosol metal concentrations with Ni and Cr biomarker levels in e-cigarette 
users from Maryland.
METHODS: We recruited 64 e-cigarette users from December 2015 to March 2016. We 
collected urine, saliva, and exhaled breath condensate (EBC), data on 
e-cigarette use, and samples from their e-cigarette device (dispenser e-liquid, 
aerosol, and tank e-liquid).
RESULTS: Median Ni and Cr levels were 0.73 and 0.39μg/g creatinine in urine, 
2.25 and 1.53μg/L in saliva, and 1.25 and 0.29μg/L in EBC. In adjusted models, 
tertiles 2 and 3 of aerosol Ni concentrations were associated with 16% and 72% 
higher urine Ni and 202% and 321% higher saliva Ni compared to the lowest 
tertile. Tertile 3 of aerosol Cr levels were associated with 193% higher saliva 
Cr. An earlier time to first vape in the morning and more frequent coil change 
were associated with higher urine Ni. Tertile 2 of e-liquid consumption per week 
and voltage were associated with higher saliva Ni levels than tertile 1.
CONCLUSION: Positive associations of Ni and Cr aerosol concentrations with 
corresponding Ni and Cr biomarker levels indicate e-cigarette emissions increase 
metal internal dose. Increased e-cigarette use and consumption were also 
associated with higher Ni biomarker levels. Metal level standards are needed to 
prevent involuntary metal exposure among e-cigarette users.

Do electronic cigarettes impart a lower potential disease burden than 
conventional tobacco cigarettes? Review on E-cigarette vapor versus tobacco 
smoke.

Oh AY(1), Kacker A.

York, U.S.A.

OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Development and utilization of electronic cigarettes 
(ECs) resulted from the search for healthier alternatives to conventional 
tobacco cigarettes (TCs) and the search for alternative methods for quitting 
TCs. This review compares the potential disease burden presented by TC smoke to 
that of EC vapor.
METHODS: Potential disease burden of EC vapor versus TC smoke was assessed by 
reviewing clinical studies that measured inhaled components. Chemicals and 
carcinogens produced by vapor versus smoke were compared.
RESULTS: Studies show that EC vapors contain far less carcinogenic particles 
than TC smoke. Whereas ECs have the ability to reach peak serum 
cotinine/nicotine levels comparable to that of TCs, ECs do not cause an increase 
in total white blood cell count; thus, ECs have the potential to lower the risk 
of atherosclerosis and systemic inflammation. Use of ECs has been shown to 
improve indoor air quality in a home exposed to TC smoke. This reduces 
secondhand smoke exposure, thus having the potential to decrease respiratory 
illness/asthma, middle-ear disease, sudden infant death syndrome, and more. 
However, some studies claim that propylene glycol (PG) vapor can induce 
respiratory irritation and increase chances for asthma. To minimize risks, EC 
manufacturers are replacing PG with distilled water and glycerin for vapor 
production.
CONCLUSION: Based on the comparison of the chemical analysis of EC and TC 
carcinogenic profiles and association with health-indicating parameters, ECs 
impart a lower potential disease burden than conventional TCs.

INTRODUCTION: Most adult cigarette smokers who use e-cigarettes are dual 
cigarette and e-cigarette (CC-EC) users, yet little is known about relative 
consumption of cigarettes to e-cigarettes and any associated harm reduction.
METHODS: Rate of substitution from cigarettes to e-cigarettes at week 6 and 
change in biomarkers of exposure and potential harm were examined among dual 
dual cigarette and e-cigarette users [64/114 (56%); 35 Black, 29 Latino] in an 
e-cigarette switching randomized trial.
RESULTS: Dual users averaged 79% substitution of cigarettes for e-cigarettes at 
week 6, resulting in a reduction from baseline of 70.0 ± 54.1 cigarettes per 
week (p < .001). Total nicotine consumption remained stable (baseline: 1160.5 ± 
1042.1 pg/mL of cotinine, week 6: 1312.5 ± 1725.9 pg/mL of cotinine, p = .47), 
while significant reductions were seen in the potent lung carcinogen 
4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridul)-1-butanol (NNAL) (-55.9 ± 88.6 ng/ml, p < 
.001), carbon monoxide (-6.3 ± 8.6 ppm, p < .001), and self-reported respiratory 
symptoms (-3.3 ± 8.0, p = .002). No significant changes were found in blood 
pressure or spirometry. Greater substitution from cigarettes to e-cigarettes was 
associated with larger reductions in NNAL (r = -.29, p = .02).
CONCLUSIONS: The predominant dual-use pattern was characterized by regular 
e-cigarette and intermittent cigarette use. Findings demonstrate the short-term 
harm reduction potential of this dual-use pattern in Black and Latino smokers 
and suggest that the greatest benefit, aside from cessation of both products, is 
achieved by higher substitution of e-cigarettes for cigarettes. Findings need 
confirmation in a larger sample with longer follow-up in dual users with greater 
variability in the rate of substitution.
CLINICALTRIALS.GOV IDENTIFIER: NCT03511001.
IMPLICATIONS: Findings suggest short-term harm reduction potential of dual 
cigarette-e-cigarette use for Black and Latino smokers. Results also demonstrate 
the heterogeneity of dual-use, with the greatest harm reduction seen in dual 
users with higher rates of substitution from cigarettes to e-cigarettes. Study 
results should be confirmed in a full clinical trial with long-term follow-up to 
evaluate maintenance of dual-use patterns and associated harm reduction 
potential over time.

BACKGROUND: Nicotine pharmacokinetic assessments of electronic nicotine delivery 
systems (ENDS) are crucial to understand their ability to provide an alternative 
to cigarette smoking. Subjective effects data also strongly contribute to this 
understanding. The BIDI® Stick is a disposable ENDS product which contains 
59 mg/ml nicotine benzoate salt and various flavours.
METHODS: In this study, we assessed nicotine pharmacokinetics and subjective 
effects of 6 flavour variants of BIDI® Stick ENDS in adult smokers, compared to 
cigarettes and a comparator ENDS product. During each of eight study visits, 18 
volunteer smoker subjects randomly used one of either their usual brand (UB) of 
cigarette, a BIDI® Stick ENDS, or a comparator ENDS (JUUL 59 mg/ml nicotine with 
Virginia Tobacco flavour), during both controlled (10 puffs, 30 s apart) and ad 
libitum (60 min) puffing sessions. Blood samples were collected at various time 
points and subjective effects questionnaires were administered.
RESULTS: Mean [SD] plasma nicotine Cmax 0-120 was not significantly different 
between BIDI® Stick ENDS with any flavour (range 15.3 [9.90] ng/ml for BIDI® 
Stick Winter to 17.6 [9.00] ng/ml for BIDI® Stick Classic) and UB cigarettes 
(16.2 [9.17] ng/ml). Mean [SD] AUC0-120 (range 569.7 [327.29] to 628.6 
[408.99]  min*ng/ml for BIDI® Stick ENDS and 747.1 [325.48]  min*ng/ml for UB 
cigarettes) and median Tmax 0-120 (range 5-7 min for all BIDI® Stick ENDS and UB 
cigarettes) values were also not significantly different between BIDI® Stick 
ENDS and UB cigarettes, while subjective effects measures were also similar 
between BIDI® Stick ENDS and UB cigarettes. Mean [SD] plasma nicotine Cmax 
0-120, AUC0-120, and median Tmax 0-120 were 6.8 [4.13] ng/ml, 243.6 [179.04] 
min*ng/ml, and 5 min, respectively, for JUUL ENDS. These values were 
significantly different compared with those for all BIDI® Stick ENDS and UB 
cigarettes for both Cmax 0-120 and AUC0-120 but not for Tmax 0-120.
CONCLUSIONS: BIDI® Stick ENDS delivered nicotine to users comparably to their UB 
combustible cigarette and higher than JUUL ENDS, and also elicited similar 
subjective effects such as satisfaction and relief. Thus, the BIDI® Stick ENDS 
may be a satisfying alternative to cigarettes among current smokers and may 
support their transitioning away from cigarette smoking.

INTRODUCTION: This study examined the predictive relationships between 
biomarkers of nicotine exposure and 16-item self-reported level of tobacco 
dependence (TD) and subsequent tobacco use outcomes.
AIMS AND METHODS: The Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study 
surveyed adult current established tobacco users who provided urine biospecimens 
at Wave 1 (September 2013-December 2014) and completed the Wave 2 (October 
2014-October 2015) interview (n = 6872). Mutually exclusive user groups at Wave 
1 included: Cigarette Only, E-cigarette Only, Cigar Only, Hookah Only, Smokeless 
Tobacco Only, Cigarette Plus E-cigarette, multiple tobacco product users who 
smoked cigarettes, and multiple tobacco product users who did not smoke 
cigarettes. Total Nicotine Equivalents (TNE-2) and TD were measured at Wave 1. 
Approximate one-year outcomes included frequency/quantity used, quitting, and 
adding/switching to different tobacco products.
RESULTS: For Cigarette Only smokers and multiple tobacco product users who 
smoked cigarettes, higher TD and TNE-2 were associated with: a tendency to smoke 
more, smoking more frequently over time, decreased likelihood of switching away 
from cigarettes, and decreased probability of quitting after one year. For other 
product user groups, Wave 1 TD and/or TNE-2 were less consistently related to 
changes in quantity and frequency of product use, or for adding or switching 
products, but higher TNE-2 was more consistently predictive of decreased 
probability of quitting.
CONCLUSIONS: Self-reported TD and nicotine exposure assess common and 
independent aspects of dependence in relation to tobacco use behaviors for 
cigarette smokers. For other product user groups, nicotine exposure is a more 
consistent predictor of quitting than self-reported TD.
IMPLICATIONS: This study suggests that smoking cigarettes leads to the most 
coherent pattern of associations consistent with a syndrome of TD. Because 
cigarettes continue to be prevalent and harmful, efforts to decrease their use 
may be accelerated via conventional means (eg, smoking cessation interventions 
and treatments), but also perhaps by decreasing their dependence potential. The 
implications for noncombustible tobacco products are less clear as the stability 
of tobacco use patterns that include products such as e-cigarettes continue to 
evolve. TD, nicotine exposure measures, and consumption could be used in studies 
that attempt to understand and predict product-specific tobacco use behavioral 
outcomes.

BACKGROUND In 2019, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 
described the criteria for the diagnosis of e-cigarette or vaping product 
use-associated lung injury (EVALI), which may be caused by contamination of 
delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinoid (THC) e-liquids with vitamin E acetate. This 
report describes a case of a 20-year-old man with a history of recreational drug 
use that included vaping, who presented with EVALI and a coagulopathy associated 
with thrombotic events. CASE REPORT We present a 20-year-old patient who worked 
at a cannabidiol (CBD) manufacturing facility with a history of e-cigarette use 
and polysubstance abuse in remission who presented with respiratory and 
gastrointestinal symptoms accompanied by 50-pound weight loss over 6 months. The 
patient had been vaping with nicotine and THC-containing e-cigarettes multiple 
times per day for 1.5 years. He met the CDC surveillance criteria for EVALI, 
consisting of respiratory symptoms and infiltrates on imaging within 90 days of 
vaping, and was found to have eosinophilic pneumonia secondary to THC-containing 
e-cigarette use. Additionally, thrombi were detected in the pulmonary arteries, 
right saphenous vein, and right ventricle. A segmental infarct was noted in the 
inferior pole of the left kidney. CONCLUSIONS We present the second case report 
potentially linking e-cigarette use with clinically significant thrombogenesis, 
the first with both arterial and venous thromboses. This report demonstrates the 
importance of taking a history of e-cigarette use in patients presenting with 
lung injury. Although EVALI and the diagnostic criteria have only recently been 
described, systemic effects, including coagulopathy, are now being reported.

CONTEXT: It has been indicated that acute active and passive tobacco cigarette 
smoking may cause changes on redox status balance that may result in significant 
pathologies. However, no study has evaluated the effects of active and passive 
e-cigarette smoking on redox status of consumers.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the acute effects of active and passive e-cigarette and 
tobacco cigarette smoking on selected redox status markers.
METHODS: Using a randomized single-blind crossover design, 30 participants (15 
smokers and 15 nonsmokers) were exposed to three different experimental 
conditions. Smokers underwent a control session, an active tobacco cigarette 
smoking session (smoked 2 cigarettes within 30-min) and an active e-cigarette 
smoking session (smoked a pre-determined number of puffs within 30-min using a 
liquid with 11 ng/ml nicotine). Similarly, nonsmokers underwent a control 
session, a passive tobacco cigarette smoking session (exposure of 1 h to 
23 ± 1 ppm of CO in a 60 m(3) environmental chamber) and a passive e-cigarette 
smoking session (exposure of 1 h to air enriched with pre- determined number of 
puffs in a 60 m(3) environmental chamber). Total antioxidant capacity (TAC), 
catalase activity (CAT) and reduced glutathione (GSH) were assessed in 
participants' blood prior to, immediately after, and 1-h post-exposure.
RESULTS: TAC, CAT and GSH remained similar to baseline levels immediately after 
and 1-h-post exposure (p > 0.05) in all trials.
CONCLUSIONS: Tobacco and e-cigarette smoking exposure do not acutely alter the 
response of the antioxidant system, neither under active nor passive smoking 
conditions. Overall, there is not distinction between tobacco and e-cigarette 
active and passive smoking effects on specific redox status indices.

INTRODUCTION: Adolescents undergoing pediatric orthopaedic surgery typically 
experience an uncomplicated postoperative course. However, adolescence 
represents a unique transition period from pediatric to adult physiology. As a 
result, the astute pediatric orthopaedic surgeon will be aware of unique medical 
and social scenarios which are relevant to adolescents during the perioperative 
course including the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), prevalence of mental 
health conditions, and rising use of electronic cigarettes or "vaping" to 
consume nicotine and cannibas.
DISCUSSION: Adolescents are at a greater risk of VTE after pediatric orthopaedic 
surgery. In particular, adolescent females with a family history of blood 
clotting disorders and those with a change in mobility after surgery should be 
considered for prophylaxis. The prevalence of adolescent mental health 
conditions including anxiety, depression, and behavioral issues is increasing in 
the United States. Higher levels of preoperative anxiety and the presence of 
mental health pathology are associated with slower recovery, higher levels of 
postoperative pain, and the increased likelihood for chronic pain. Several quick 
screening instruments are available to assess adolescents for preoperative 
anxiety risk, including the Visual Analogue Scale for Anxiety or the Amsterdam 
Perioperative Anxiety Information Scale. Unfortunately, electronic cigarettes 
have become increasingly popular for the consumption of nicotine and cannabis 
among adolescents. Preoperative use of combustive cigarettes (nicotine/cannabis) 
represents perioperative risks for induction/anesthesia, postoperative pain, and 
analgesia requirements and issues with delayed wound and fracture healing.
CONCLUSIONS: VTE, underlying mental health conditions, and usage of nicotine and 
cannabis are clear detriments to the recovery and healing of adolescent patients 
following orthopaedic surgery. Therefore, standardized screening for adolescents 
before orthopaedic surgery is indicated to identify perioperative risk factors 
which have negative impacts on functional outcomes.

AIMS: Electronic (e)-cigarettes have been marketed as a 'healthy' alternative to 
traditional combustible cigarettes and as an effective method of smoking 
cessation. There are, however, a paucity of data to support these claims. In 
fact, e-cigarettes are implicated in endothelial dysfunction and oxidative 
stress in the vasculature and the lungs. The mechanisms underlying these side 
effects remain unclear. Here, we investigated the effects of e-cigarette vapour 
on vascular function in smokers and experimental animals to determine the 
underlying mechanisms.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Acute e-cigarette smoking produced a marked impairment of 
endothelial function in chronic smokers determined by flow-mediated dilation. In 
mice, e-cigarette vapour without nicotine had more detrimental effects on 
endothelial function, markers of oxidative stress, inflammation, and lipid 
peroxidation than vapour containing nicotine. These effects of e-cigarette 
vapour were largely absent in mice lacking phagocytic NADPH oxidase (NOX-2) or 
upon treatment with the endothelin receptor blocker macitentan or the FOXO3 
activator bepridil. We also established that the e-cigarette product acrolein, a 
reactive aldehyde, recapitulated many of the NOX-2-dependent effects of 
e-cigarette vapour using in vitro blood vessel incubation.
CONCLUSIONS: E-cigarette vapour exposure increases vascular, cerebral, and 
pulmonary oxidative stress via a NOX-2-dependent mechanism. Our study identifies 
the toxic aldehyde acrolein as a key mediator of the observed adverse vascular 
consequences. Thus, e-cigarettes have the potential to induce marked adverse 
cardiovascular, pulmonary, and cerebrovascular consequences. Since e-cigarette 
use is increasing, particularly amongst youth, our data suggest that aggressive 
steps are warranted to limit their health risks.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies have examined the characteristics of open and 
closed system electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) users, but 
population-level information on nicotine exposure among these users has not been 
available.
METHODS: We analyzed nicotine biomarker and survey data from Wave 3 of the 
Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) study collected from October 
2015 to October 2016. We identified 277 exclusive ENDS users and 468 dual 
cigarette and ENDS users and analyzed concentrations of nicotine and its 
metabolites obtained from urine samples by device type and other 
characteristics, such as frequency of use and e-liquid flavor.
RESULTS: Among exclusive ENDS users, open system users had higher levels of 
total nicotine exposure (TNE-2) than closed system users [8.8 μmol/g creatinine 
(95% confidence interval [CI] = 5.3-14.8 μmol/g vs. 2.0 μmol/g (95% CI = 0.7-5.4 
μmol/g)]. However, TNE-2 concentrations were similar when open and closed system 
users were stratified as daily [26.4 μmol/g (95% CI = 20.1-34.7 μmol/g) vs. 27.1 
μmol/g (95% CI = 16.4-44.9 μmol/g)] and nondaily [0.5 μmol/g (95% CI = 0.1-1.9 
μmol/g) vs. 0.2 μmol/g (95% CI = 0.0-0.7 μmol/g)] ENDS users. Dual users 
generally had higher nicotine exposure than exclusive users.
CONCLUSIONS: Nicotine exposure was observed to be higher among exclusive open 
system ENDS users compared with closed system users, but levels were similar 
when users were stratified by frequency of use.
IMPACT: These results suggest that exclusive ENDS users with similar use 
patterns receive comparable levels of nicotine, regardless of whether they use 
open or closed system devices.

Background: E-cigarettes (ECs) seem to be a less harmful alternative for 
conventional cigarettes, however, very little is still known about the exposure 
to some elements, which are the components of this device and may contaminate 
the nicotine liquid. The aim of this study is to assess whether e-cigarette 
users are more exposed to 12 elements detected in aerosol than non-smokers and 
conventional cigarette smokers, using their concentrations in urine as exposure 
biomarkers. Methods: A cross-sectional, group-based survey was carried out using 
90 volunteers classified into groups of non-smokers, EC-only users, dual EC 
users-cigarette smokers and cigarette-only smokers. Using inductively coupled 
plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and electrothermal atomic absorption 
spectrometry (ETAAS), Cr, Ni, Co, Ag, In, Mn, Ba, Sr, V, Sb, Cd and Pb levels 
were measured in spot urine samples. Among the selected groups, a comparison was 
made using the analysis of covariance and correlations with EC usage pattern 
were assessed by multiple linear regression. Results: Element concentrations in 
urine of EC-users were not significantly different from the levels found in 
non-smokers and smokers. Only in the case of Ba, Ni and Sb was a significant 
correlation found in relation to some e-cigarette usage patterns. Conclusion: 
Transfer of the investigated elements to the EC aerosol was not found to be a 
substantial source of exposure in EC users who quitted smoking.

BACKGROUND: Understanding vaping patterns of electronic cigarette (EC) use is 
important to understand the real-life exposure to EC vapor. Long term 
information on vaping topography in relation to tobacco cigarette (TC) smoking 
cessation success has not been explored.
METHODS: Observational non-blinded study where active TC smokers were asked to 
replace TC with EC over 4 weeks (replacement phase, RP) followed by exclusive EC 
use for an additional 12 weeks (maintenance phase, MP). TC use and EC compliance 
was monitored weekly. Subjects were classified as success or failure whether or 
not they completed the protocol. Vaping information was stored and downloaded 
directly from the EC device and averaged per calendar day for analysis.
RESULTS: From 25 subjects that followed the protocol, sixteen succeeded in 
completing the RP and 8 the MP (32%). No significant differences in baseline 
characteristics were noted between subjects in the success and failure groups 
including markers of nicotine addiction, plasma cotinine levels or smoking 
history. Success subjects showed significantly longer puff duration (seconds per 
vape) and total overall vapor exposure (number of vapes x average vape duration 
or vape-seconds) in both study phases. Furthermore, subjects in the success 
group continued to increase the number of vapes, device voltage and wattage 
significantly as they transitioned into the MP. After an initial drop, subjects 
in the success group were able to regain plasma cotinine levels comparable to 
their TC use while subjects in the failure group could not. Cotinine levels 
significantly correlated with the average number of daily vapes and 
vapes-seconds, but not with other vaping parameters.
CONCLUSION: The topography of smokers who adhere to exclusive EC use reflects a 
progressive and dynamic device adaptation over weeks to maintain baseline 
cotinine levels. The higher inhaled volume over time should be considered when 
addressing the potential toxic effects of EC and the variable EC adherence when 
addressing public health policies regarding their use.

E-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury was recognized in the 
United States in the summer of 2019 and is typified by acute respiratory 
distress, shortness of breath, chest pain, cough, and fever, associated with 
vaping. It can mimic many of the manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19). Some investigators have suggested that E-cigarette or vaping product 
use-associated lung injury was due to tetrahydrocannabinol or vitamin E acetate 
oil mixed with the electronic cigarette liquid. In experimental rodent studies 
initially designed to study the effect of electronic cigarette use on the 
cardiovascular system, we observed an E-cigarette or vaping product 
use-associated lung injury-like condition that occurred acutely after use of a 
nichrome heating element at high power, without the use of tetrahydrocannabinol, 
vitamin E, or nicotine. Lung lesions included thickening of the alveolar wall 
with foci of inflammation, red blood cell congestion, obliteration of alveolar 
spaces, and pneumonitis in some cases; bronchi showed accumulation of fibrin, 
inflammatory cells, and mucus plugs. Electronic cigarette users should be 
cautioned about the potential danger of operating electronic cigarette units at 
high settings; the possibility that certain heating elements may be deleterious; 
and that E-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury may not be 
dependent upon tetrahydrocannabinol, vitamin E, or nicotine.

BACKGROUND: Surveys have been instrumental in describing adolescent use of 
tobacco, electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes), and marijuana. However, objective 
biomarker data are lacking. We compared adolescent self-reported use to urinary 
biomarkers.
METHODS: From April 2017 to April 2018, adolescents 12 to 21 years old completed 
an anonymous questionnaire regarding tobacco, e-cigarette, and marijuana use and 
provided a urine sample. Urine was analyzed for biomarkers cotinine, total 
4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol, and tetrahydrocannabinolic acid 
(THCA).
RESULTS: Of 517 participants, 2.9% reported using tobacco, 14.3% e-cigarettes, 
and 11.4% marijuana in the past week. Only 2% reporting no smoking had total 
4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol levels above cutoff (14.5 pg/mL); 
2% of non-e-cigarette users had cotinine above cutoff (10 ng/mL); 2% of those 
denying marijuana use had THCA above cutoff (10 ng/mL). Daily e-cigarette users 
showed significantly higher median cotinine than nondaily users (315.4 
[interquartile range (IQR) 1375.9] vs 1.69 ng/mL [IQR 28.2]; P < .003). Overall, 
40% who reported using nicotine-free products had cotinine >10 ng/mL. Pod users' 
median cotinine was significantly higher than in nonpod users (259.03 [IQR 
1267.69] vs 1.61 ng/mL [IQR 16.3]; P < .003). Median THCA among daily marijuana 
users was higher than in nondaily users (560.1 [IQR 1248.3] vs 7.2 ng/mL [IQR 
254.9]; P = .04). Sixty-one percent of those with cotinine >10 ng/mL vs 39% of 
those with cotinine<10 ng/mL had THCA >10 ng/mL (P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents' self-report correlated with measured urinary 
biomarkers, but subjects were unaware of their nicotine exposure. More frequent 
e-cigarette and pod use correlated with elevated biomarkers. Co-use of tobacco, 
e-cigarettes, and marijuana was corroborated by higher THCA in those with higher 
cotinine.

Exposure to cigarette smoke is known to result in impaired host defense 
responses and immune suppressive effects. However, the effects of new and 
emerging tobacco products, such as e-cigarettes, on the immune status of the 
respiratory epithelium are largely unknown. We conducted a clinical study 
collecting superficial nasal scrape biopsies, nasal lavage, urine, and serum 
from nonsmokers, cigarette smokers, and e-cigarette users and assessed them for 
changes in immune gene expression profiles. Smoking status was determined based 
on a smoking history and a 3- to 4-wk smoking diary and confirmed using serum 
cotinine and urine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL) levels. 
Total RNA from nasal scrape biopsies was analyzed using the nCounter Human 
Immunology v2 Expression panel. Smoking cigarettes or vaping e-cigarettes 
resulted in decreased expression of immune-related genes. All genes with 
decreased expression in cigarette smokers (n = 53) were also decreased in 
e-cigarette smokers. Additionally, vaping e-cigarettes was associated with 
suppression of a large number of unique genes (n = 305). Furthermore, the 
e-cigarette users showed a greater suppression of genes common with those 
changed in cigarette smokers. This was particularly apparent for suppressed 
expression of transcription factors, such as EGR1, which was functionally 
associated with decreased expression of 5 target genes in cigarette smokers and 
18 target genes in e-cigarette users. Taken together, these data indicate that 
vaping e-cigarettes is associated with decreased expression of a large number of 
immune-related genes, which are consistent with immune suppression at the level 
of the nasal mucosa.

BACKGROUND: The emergence of a plethora of new tobacco products marketed as 
being less harmful than smoking, such as electronic cigarettes and heated 
tobacco products, and the increased popularity of recreational marijuana have 
raised concerns about the potential cardiovascular risk associated with their 
use.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the use of novel 
tobacco products or marijuana can cause the development of proarrhythmic 
substrate and eventually lead to arrhythmias.
METHODS: Rats were exposed to smoke from tobacco, marijuana, or 
cannabinoid-depleted marijuana, to aerosol from electronic cigarettes or heated 
tobacco products, or to clean air once per day for 8 weeks, following by assays 
for blood pressure, cardiac function, ex vivo electrophysiology, and 
histochemistry.
RESULTS: The rats exposed to tobacco or marijuana products exhibited 
progressively increased systolic blood pressure, decreased cardiac systolic 
function with chamber dilation, and reduced overall heart rate variability, 
relative to the clean air negative control group. Atrial fibrillation and 
ventricular tachycardia testing by ex vivo optical mapping revealed a 
significantly higher susceptibility to each, with a shortened effective 
refractory period and prolonged calcium transient duration. Histological 
analysis indicated that in all exposure conditions except for air, exposure to 
smoke or aerosol from tobacco or marijuana products caused severe fibrosis with 
decreased microvessel density and higher level of sympathetic nerve innervation.
CONCLUSION: These pathophysiological results indicate that tobacco and marijuana 
products can induce arrhythmogenic substrates involved in cardiac electrical, 
structural, and neural remodeling, facilitating the development of arrhythmias.

Update of
    Res Sq. 2024 Feb 02;:

Nicotine use is a leading cause of preventable deaths worldwide, and most of 
those who attempt to quit will relapse. While electronic cigarettes and other 
electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) were presented as a safer 
alternative to traditional cigarettes and promoted as devices to help 
traditional tobacco smokers reduce or quit smoking, they have instead 
contributed to increasing nicotine use among youths. Despite this, ENDS also 
represent a useful tool to create novel preclinical animal models of nicotine 
exposure that more accurately represent human nicotine use. In this study, we 
validated a chronic, intermittent, ENDS-based passive vapor exposure model in 
mice, and then measured changes in multiple behaviors related to nicotine 
abstinence. First, we performed a behavioral dose curve to investigate the 
effects of different nicotine inter-vape intervals on various measures including 
body weight, locomotor activity, and pain hypersensitivity. Next, we performed a 
pharmacokinetic study to measure plasma levels of nicotine and cotinine 
following chronic exposure for each inter-vape interval. Finally, we utilized a 
behavior test battery at a single dosing regimen that produces blood levels 
equivalent to human smokers in order to characterize the effects of chronic 
nicotine, vehicle, or passive airflow and identified nicotine-induced 
impairments in cognitive behavior.

INTRODUCTION: Dual use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) and combustible 
cigarettes is a major public health issue. It is generally accepted that 
exclusive e-cigarette use is less harmful than exclusive combustible cigarette 
use, but most e-cigarette users continue to smoke combustible cigarettes as 
well. To what extent the use of e-cigarettes reduces harm in people who continue 
to smoke combustible cigarettes has been debated. The aim of this study was to 
explore the utility of biomarkers as measures of dual use.
METHODS: In two human studies of participants who used e-cigarettes only or both 
combustible cigarettes and e-cigarettes, we measured urine concentrations of the 
metabolites of nicotine (total nicotine equivalents) as well as two biomarkers 
of tobacco exposure: 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL), a 
tobacco-specific carcinogen metabolite, and nicotelline, a tobacco alkaloid not 
found in significant concentrations in e-cigarette products.
RESULTS: The presence of nicotine metabolites indicates either e-cigarette or 
combustible cigarette use. Nicotelline (half-life of 2-3 hours) indicates recent 
combustible cigarette use and NNAL (half-life of 10 days or more), indicates 
combustible cigarette use occurring within several weeks prior to sample 
collection.
CONCLUSIONS: Nicotelline and NNAL are useful biomarkers for combustible tobacco 
use in users e-cigarettes. The application of these biomarkers provides a tool 
to help assess whether, or to what extent, dual use of e-cigarettes and 
combustible cigarettes reduces harm compared to sole use of combustible 
cigarettes. These biomarkers can also verify exclusive use of e-cigarettes over 
short (24 hour) or long (several week) time periods.
IMPLICATIONS: To what extent dual use of e-cigarettes and combustible cigarettes 
reduce harm compared to smoking combustible cigarettes only is of considerable 
public health interest. We show that the levels of the minor tobacco alkaloid 
nicotelline and the nitrosamine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone 
(NNK) are extremely low in electronic cigarette fluids. The urine biomarkers 
nicotelline and the NNK metabolite 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol 
(NNAL) are indicative of cigarette smoking and can be used to assess recent and 
past smoking in dual users.

BACKGROUND: The abuse liability of the JUUL System (JS) in four flavors were 
evaluated compared to combustible cigarettes, nicotine gum, and a comparator 
electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) with pharmacokinetics (PK) and 
subjective effects.
METHODS: Adult smokers (N = 66; 50.0 % female; mean age = 41.1; 63.6 % white) 
completed a 7-arm within-subjects cross-over product-use study while confined to 
a clinical laboratory. Participants used JS in four flavors (Virginia Tobacco, 
Mango, Mint, Creme, [5.0 % nicotine; 59 mg/mL]), their usual brand (UB) 
cigarette, a comparator ENDS (VUSE Solo; 4.8 % nicotine, tobacco-flavor), and 
mint nicotine gum (4 mg) under controlled use conditions. After each product 
use, nicotine PK and subjective effects were assessed.
RESULTS: Maximum plasma nicotine levels (Cmax-BL), rate of plasma nicotine rise, 
overall nicotine exposure (AUC0-60-BL), and subjective liking and satisfaction 
of JS were significantly lower than UB cigarettes. These parameters were 
generally greater for JS than nicotine gum; the comparator ENDS was somewhat 
lower but within the range of JS. Nicotine PK did not differ among the Mint, 
Mango, and Virginia Tobacco JS flavors. Mint and Mango were rated as more 
satisfying than Virginia Tobacco and Creme.
CONCLUSIONS: Controlled use of JS among adult smokers resulted in nicotine 
delivery, product liking, and satisfaction that were less than that of 
combustible cigarettes but generally greater than nicotine gum. These results 
support the conclusion that JS has lower abuse liability than combustible 
cigarettes, higher abuse liability than nicotine gum, and may provide sufficient 
nicotine delivery and satisfying effects to support substitution for combustible 
cigarettes among adult smokers.

INTRODUCTION: Use of e-cigarettes among never-smokers has substantially 
increased; yet there are few descriptions of the consequences of such use. We 
assessed whether adult never-smokers can have withdrawal from cessation of 
e-cigarettes.
METHODS: In an un-blinded pre-post clinical trial, 30 never-smoker daily 
e-cigarette users used their own nicotine-containing e-cigarette for 7 days 
followed by 6 days of biologically confirmed abstinence. Participants monitored 
symptoms of nicotine withdrawal nightly via an Interactive Voice Response 
system. They attended three lab visits/week to provide expired carbon monoxide 
and urine samples to determine compliance.
FINDINGS: Abstinence increased all the DSM5 symptoms of tobacco withdrawal and 
this occurred in the majority of participants. The increase in severity of 
withdrawal was small and rarely impaired functioning.
CONCLUSIONS: Our finding suggests that withdrawal symptoms can occur in 
never-smokers who stop e-cigarettes abruptly. However, the severity of 
withdrawal appears to be small and may not be of clinical or regulatory 
significance. Although our sample size was small and thus replication tests of 
our results are indicated, it may be prudent to warn never-smokers that 
withdrawal symptoms may occur.
IMPLICATIONS: This study indicates that withdrawal symptoms can occur in 
never-smokers who are daily e-cigarette users. However, the severity of 
withdrawal from e-cigarette abstinence in never-smokers appears to be small and 
may not be of clinical or regulatory significance. Given our small sample size, 
replication of our results is warranted. Nevertheless, it might be prudent to 
warn never-smokers of addiction to e-cigarettes.Clinical Trial Registration =

BACKGROUND: There is limited evidence about the effects of dual electronic 
cigarette (e-cig) and combustible cigarette use on lung health or other health 
outcomes. Studies that have evaluated these outcomes have not included estimates 
of e-cig or cigarette exposure in the analyses.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data analyzed were from 263 smokers participating in a 
randomized controlled trial designed to encourage participants to reduce their 
combustible cigarette use by substituting with an e-cig or a non-electronic 
cigarette substitute (cig-sub). t-tests were used to evaluate changes from 
baseline at 1 month and 3 months in lung function, blood pressure, pulse, 
exhaled carbon monoxide, and weight. Linear mixed effects models were used to 
test associations between health outcomes and study product group, including 
exposure to the study products (e-cig and cig-sub times used and days used in 
the past 7 days) and cigarettes per day (CPD).
RESULTS: There were few significant differences between the groups for lung 
function indices at any time point in the unadjusted analyses. There were 
significant reductions in diastolic blood pressure and pulse at 1 month in the 
unadjusted analyses for those in the e-cig group compared to the cig-sub group. 
CPD decreased significantly more for the e-cig group than for the cig-sub group 
at both time points. There were no significant associations between any measured 
health outcomes and group in the linear mixed effects models.
CONCLUSION: E-cig use did not contribute to significant changes in health 
outcome markers as compared with use of a non-electronic cig-sub.

INTRODUCTION: Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are purported to deliver 
nicotine aerosol without any toxic combustion products present in tobacco smoke. 
In this longitudinal within-subjects observational study, we evaluated the 
effects of e-cigarettes on nicotine delivery and exposure to selected 
carcinogens and toxicants.
METHODS: We measured seven nicotine metabolites and 17 tobacco smoke exposure 
biomarkers in the urine samples of 20 smokers collected before and after 
switching to pen-style M201 e-cigarettes for 2 weeks. Biomarkers were 
metabolites of 13 major carcinogens and toxicants in cigarette smoke: one 
tobacco-specific nitrosamine (NNK), eight volatile organic compounds 
(1,3-butadiene, crotonaldehyde, acrolein, benzene, acrylamide, acrylonitrile, 
ethylene oxide, and propylene oxide), and four polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 
(naphthalene, fluorene, phenanthrene, and pyrene). Changes in urine biomarkers 
concentration were tested using repeated measures analysis of variance.
RESULTS: In total, 45% of participants reported complete abstinence from 
cigarette smoking at 2 weeks, while 55% reported continued smoking. Levels of 
total nicotine and some polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon metabolites did not 
change after switching from tobacco to e-cigarettes. All other biomarkers 
significantly decreased after 1 week of using e-cigarettes (p < .05). After 1 
week, the greatest percentage reductions in biomarkers levels were observed for 
metabolites of 1,3-butadiene, benzene, and acrylonitrile. Total NNAL, a 
metabolite of NNK, declined by 57% and 64% after 1 and 2 weeks, respectively, 
while 3-hydroxyfluorene levels declined by 46% at week 1, and 34% at week 2.
CONCLUSIONS: After switching from tobacco to e-cigarettes, nicotine exposure 
remains unchanged, while exposure to selected carcinogens and toxicants is 
substantially reduced.
IMPLICATIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study that demonstrates that 
substituting tobacco cigarettes with an e-cigarette may reduce user exposure to 
numerous toxicants and carcinogens otherwise present in tobacco cigarettes. Data 
on reduced exposure to harmful constituents that are present in tobacco 
cigarettes and e-cigarettes can aid in evaluating e-cigarettes as a potential 
harm reduction device.

Lactate is a metabolite produced during anaerobic glycolysis for ATP 
resynthesis, which accumulates during hypoxia and muscle contraction. Tobacco 
smoking significantly increases blood lactate. Here we conducted a 
counter-balanced crossover study to examine whether this effect is associated 
with inhaling nicotine or burned carbon particles. Fifteen male smokers (aged 23 
to 26 years) were randomized into 3 inhalation conditions: tobacco smoking, 
nicotine vaping, and nicotine-free vaping, conducted two days apart. An 
electronic thermal evaporator (e-cigarette) was used for vaping. We have 
observed an increased blood lactate (+62%, main effect: p < 0.01) and a 
decreased blood glucose (−12%, main effect: p < 0.05) during thermal air 
inhalations regardless of the content delivered. Exercise-induced lactate 
accumulation and shuttle run performance were similar for the 3 inhalation 
conditions. Tobacco smoking slightly increased the resting heart rate above the 
two vaping conditions (p < 0.05), implicating the role of burned carbon 
particles on sympathetic stimulation, independent of nicotine and thermal air. 
The exercise response in the heart rate was similar for the 3 conditions. The 
results of the study suggest that acute hypoxia was induced by breathing thermal 
air. This may explain the reciprocal increases in lactate and decreases in 
glucose. The impaired lung function in oxygen delivery of tobacco smoking is 
unrelated to nicotine.

Propylene glycol and glycerol are electronic cigarettes vehicles allowing liquid 
vaporization and nicotine transport. The respective effects of these different 
constituents on the cardiovascular system are unknown. We assessed the 
differential effects of vehicles (propylene glycol and glycerol) and nicotine on 
microcirculatory function, arterial stiffness, hemodynamic parameters and 
oxidative stress. Twenty-five tobacco smokers were exposed to vaping with and 
without nicotine, and sham vaping, in a randomized, single blind, 3-period 
crossover design study. Neither sham-vaping nor vaping in the absence of 
nicotine resulted in modifications of cardiovascular parameters or oxidative 
stress. In contrast, vaping with nicotine: 1) impaired acetylcholine mediated 
vasodilation (mean ± standard error mean) (area under curve, perfusion unit 
(PU), 3385 ± 27PU to 2271 ± 27PU, p < 0.0001); 2) increased indices of arterial 
stiffness, namely augmentation index corrected for heart rhythm (-3.5 ± 1.5% to 
1.9 ± 2.3%; p = 0.013) and pulse wave velocity (4.9 ± 0.1 m.s-1 to 5.3 ± 0.1 
m.s-1; p < 0.0001); 3) increased systolic and diastolic blood pressures as well 
as heart rate (all p < 0.0001) and finally; 4) raised plasma myeloperoxidase 
(median [interquartile range]) (13.6 ng.ml-1 [10-17.7] to 18.9 ng.ml-1 
[12.2-54.4], p = 0.005). Our findings demonstrated that high temperature 
e-cigarette vehicle vaporization does not alter micro- and macro-vascular 
function, and oxidative stress, and that these effects are solely attributable 
to nicotine.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the acute effects of nicotine-containing electronic 
cigarettes versus tobacco smoking on vascular and respiratory function and 
circulating microparticles, particularly platelet microparticles (PMPs, 
biomarker of haemostasis/thrombosis) and endothelial microparticles (EMPs, 
biomarker of endothelial function).
METHODS: Heart rate (HR), blood pressure, reactive hyperaemia index (RHI, 
microvascular reactivity), augmentation index (arterial stiffness) and 
respiratory function were assessed in 20 smokers immediately before and after 
electronic cigarettes use and tobacco smoking. The number of microparticles was 
determined by flow cytometry using counting beads as a reference. Labelling with 
Annexin-V was used to detect the total microparticle fraction. EMPs were 
characterized as CD31+CD42- and PMPs as CD31+CD42+.
RESULTS: HR increased after electronic cigarettes use and tobacco smoking 
(P < 0.001), whereas blood pressure remained unchanged (P > 0.05). RHI 
(P = 0.006), augmentation index (P = 0.010) but not augmentation index 
standardized to HR 75 bpm (P > 0.05) increased with electronic cigarettes use 
but not with tobacco smoking. Following tobacco smoking, there was a significant 
increase in total microparticles (P < 0.001), EMPs (P < 0.001) and PMPs 
(P < 0.001). In contrast, electronic cigarettes were only associated with an 
increase in PMPs (P < 0.001), with no significant changes in the total 
microparticle fraction or EMPs (all P > 0.05). Peak expiratory flow 
significantly decreased following electronic cigarettes use (P = 0.019).
CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that acute exposure to tobacco smoking as 
well as electronic cigarettes influences vascular and respiratory function. 
Where tobacco smoking significantly increased microparticle formation, 
indicative of possible endothelial injury, electronic cigarettes use induced 
vasoreactivity and decreased peak expiratory flow. These findings suggest that 
both electronic cigarettes and tobacco smoking negatively impact vascular 
function.

Despite the knowledge gap regarding the risk-benefit ratio of the electronic 
cigarette (e-cig), its use has grown exponentially, even in teenagers. E-cig 
vapor contains carcinogenic compounds (eg, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and 
acrolein) and free radicals, especially reactive oxygen species (ROS) that cause 
toxicological effects, including DNA damage. The role of e-cig voltage 
customization on molecule generation has been reported, but the effects of the 
resistance on e-cig emissions and toxicity are unknown. Here, we show that the 
manipulation of e-cig resistance influences the carbonyls production from 
nonnicotine vapor and the oxidative and inflammatory status in a rat model. 
Fixing the voltage at the conventional 3.5 V, we observed that the amount of the 
selected aldehydes increased as the resistance decreased from 1.5 to 0.25 Ω. 
Under these conditions, we exposed Sprague Dawley rats to e-cig aerosol for 
28 days, and we studied the pulmonary inflammation, oxidative stress, tissue 
damage, and blood homeostasis. We found a perturbation of the antioxidant and 
phase II enzymes, probably related to the increased ROS levels due to the 
enhanced xanthine oxidase and P450-linked monooxygenases. Furthermore, frames 
from scanning electron microscope showed a disorganization of alveolar and 
bronchial epithelium in 0.25 Ω group. Overall, various toxicological outcomes, 
widely recognized as smoke-related injuries, can potentially occur in e-cig 
consumers who use low-voltage and resistance device. Our study suggests that 
certain "tips for vaping safety" cannot be established, and encourages further 
independent investigations to help public health agencies in regulating the 
e-cig use.

4, Switzerland.

AIMS: To assess saliva cotinine levels in experienced users of e-cigarettes 
('vapers').
DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: An internet survey in 2011 and 2012, with 
collection of saliva vials by mail. Participants were 71 users of e-cigarettes 
enrolled mainly on websites and online forums dedicated to e-cigarettes.
MEASUREMENTS: Use of e-cigarettes, tobacco and nicotine medications. Collection 
of saliva by mail and analysis of cotinine by liquid chromatography-mass 
spectrometry.
FINDINGS: Most participants (89%) were former smokers, most (92%) were using 
e-cigarettes daily, had been using e-cigarettes for 12 months on average and 
puffed a median of 150 times per day on their e-cigarettes [mean = 220 
puffs/day, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 169-271]. The median concentration of 
nicotine in refill liquids was 16 mg/ml (mean = 16.4, 95% CI = 14.5-18.3). In 
the 62 e-cigarette users who, in the past 5 days, had not used any tobacco or 
nicotine medications, the median cotinine level was 353 ng/ml (mean = 374, 95% 
CI = 318-429), the correlation between cotinine and nicotine concentration in 
e-liquids was r = 0.33 (P = 0.013), and the correlation between cotinine and the 
number of cigarettes smoked per day before quitting smoking was r = 0.48 (P < 
0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: At least some experienced users of electronic cigarettes appear to 
be able to gain as much nicotine from those products as do cigarette smokers.

Electronic cigarettes (ECs) and tobacco cigarettes (TCs) both release nicotine, 
a sympathomimetic drug. We hypothesized that baseline heart rate variability 
(HRV) and hemodynamics would be similar in chronic EC and TC smokers and that 
after acute EC use, changes in HRV and hemodynamics would be attributable to 
nicotine, not non-nicotine, constituents in EC aerosol. In 100 smokers, 
including 58 chronic EC users and 42 TC smokers, baseline HRV and hemodynamics 
[blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR)] were compared. To isolate the acute 
effects of nicotine vs. non-nicotine constituents in EC aerosol, we compared 
changes in HRV, BP, and HR in EC users after using an EC with nicotine (ECN), EC 
without nicotine (EC0), nicotine inhaler (NI), or sham vaping (control). 
Outcomes were also compared with TC smokers after smoking one TC. Baseline HRV 
and hemodynamics were not different in chronic EC users and TC smokers. In EC 
users, BP and HR, but not HRV outcomes, increased only after using the ECN, 
consistent with a nicotine effect on BP and HR. Similarly, in TC smokers, BP and 
HR but not HRV outcomes increased after smoking one TC. Despite a similar 
increase in nicotine, the hemodynamic increases were significantly greater after 
TC smokers smoked one TC compared with the increases after EC users used the 
ECN. In conclusion, chronic EC and TC smokers exhibit a similar pattern of 
baseline HRV. Acute increases in BP and HR in EC users are attributable to 
nicotine, not non-nicotine, constituents in EC aerosol. The greater acute 
pressor effects after TC compared with ECN may be attributable to non-nicotine, 
combusted constituents in TC smoke.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Chronic electronic cigarette 
(EC) users and tobacco cigarette (TC) smokers exhibit a similar level of 
sympathetic nerve activity as estimated by heart rate variability. Acute 
increases in blood pressure (BP) and heart rate in EC users are attribute to 
nicotine, not non-nicotine, constituents in EC aerosol. Acute TC smoking 
increased BP significantly more than acute EC use, despite similar increases in 
plasma nicotine, suggestive of additional adverse vascular effects attributable 
to combusted, non-nicotine constituents in TC smoke.

BACKGROUND: We investigated the association between blood concentration of 
cadmium and smoking status including use of electronic cigarettes (E-cigars).
METHODS: We used data from the Korea National Health and Nutritional Survey 2013 
and 2016. A total of 4,744 participants (2,162 men and 2,582 women) were 
included and were categorized into five groups (Non-smokers, E-cigar non-users 
in past-smokers, E-cigar users in past-smokers, E-cigar non-users in 
cigarette-smokers and E-cigar users in cigarette-smokers). Cadmium blood 
concentration was categorized into tertiles. All sampling and weight variables 
were stratified, and analysis to account for the complex sampling design was 
conducted.
RESULTS: In both genders, the geometric cadmium concentration was significantly 
different according to smoking status (both genders, analysis of variance P 
value < 0.001). In men, E-cigar users were significantly higher than the 
non-smokers (P value = past-smokers, 0.017; cigarette-smokers, < 0.001) when 
fully adjusted. Compared with non-smokers, fully-adjusted odds ratios (95% 
confidence intervals) for the highest cadmium tertiles of E-cigar non-users in 
cigarette-smokers and E-cigar users in cigarette-smokers were 6.56 (3.55-12.11) 
and 5.68 (1.96-16.50) in men and 2.74 (1.42-5.29) and 1.29 (0.10-17.44) in 
women.
CONCLUSION: Conventional cigarette smoking in men and women and E-cigar use in 
men are associated with higher risk of elevated blood cadmium level. Preventive 
management of cadmium exposure monitoring in conventional cigarette-smokers and 
E-cigar users may be needed.

Electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use has had an exponential increase in 
popularity since the product was released to the public. Currently, there is a 
lack of human studies that assess different biomarker levels. This pilot study 
attempts to link e-cigarette and other tobacco product usage with clinical 
respiratory symptoms and immunoglobulin response. Subjects completed surveys in 
order to collect self-reported data on tobacco product flavor preferences. Along 
with this, plasma samples were collected to test for immunoglobulin G (IgG) and 
E (IgE) levels. Our pilot study's cohort had a 47.9% flavor preference towards 
fruit flavors and a 63.1% preference to more sweet flavors. E-cigarette and 
traditional cigarette smokers were the two subject groups to report the most 
clinical symptoms. E-cigarette users also had a significant increase in plasma 
IgE levels compared to non-tobacco users 1, and dual users had a significant 
increase in plasma IgG compared to non-tobacco users 2, cigarette smokers, and 
waterpipe smokers. Our pilot study showed that users have a preference toward 
fruit and more sweet flavors and that e-cigarette and dual use resulted in an 
augmented systemic immune response.

Electronic cigarette (EC) aerosol emissions generally contain fewer and lower 
concentrations of harmful and potentially harmful constituents, compared with 
cigarette smoke. Further studies are needed to establish whether decreased 
emissions translate to reduced health risks for EC users. In a cross-sectional 
study, biomarkers of exposure (BoE) to certain tobacco smoke toxicants and 
biomarkers of potential harm (BoPH), associated with biological processes linked 
to the potential development of smoking-related diseases and oxidative stress, 
were assessed in solus Vuse ECs users and current, former, and never smokers. In 
total, 213 participants were enrolled, and smoking status was confirmed by 
urinary cotinine, exhaled carbon monoxide, and N-(2-cyanoethyl)valine levels (EC 
users and former smokers only). During confinement participants used their usual 
product (EC or cigarette) as normal and BoE and BoPHs were assessed via blood, 
24-h urine, and physiological assessment. Significantly lower levels of all 
urinary BoE; MHBMA, HMPMA, 3-HPMA, NNN, 3-OH-B[a]P, S-PMA, NNAL (all 
p < 0.0001), and TNeq (p = 0.0074) were observed in EC users when compared with 
smokers. Moreover, significantly lower levels were observed in EC users for 3 of 
the 7 BoPH measured, carboxyhaemoglobin (p < 0.0001), soluble intercellular 
adhesion molecule-1 (p = 0.0028), and 11-dehydrothromboxane B2 (p = 0.0012), 
when compared with smokers. As compared with smokers, solus Vuse EC users have 
significantly lower exposure to tobacco toxicants for the BoE, and 3 BoPH 
measured. These results add to the weight of evidence supporting EC as part of a 
tobacco harm reduction strategy.

BACKGROUND: Electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) conventions regularly bring 
together thousands of users around the world. In these environments, secondhand 
exposures to high concentrations of e-cigarette emissions are prevalent. Some 
biomarkers for tobacco smoke exposure may be used to characterize secondhand 
e-cigarette exposures in such an environment.
METHODS: Participants who did not use any tobacco product attended four separate 
e-cigarette events for approximately six hours. Urine and saliva samples were 
collected from participants prior to the event, immediately after the event, 4-h 
after the event, and the next morning (first void). Urine samples from 34 
participants were analyzed for cotinine, trans-3'-hydroxycotinine, 
S-(3-hydroxypropyl)-N-acetylcysteine (3-HPMA), S-carboxyethyl-N-acetylcysteine 
(CEMA), select tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs), and 8-isoprostane. Saliva 
samples were analyzed for cotinine and trans-3'-hydroxycotinine.
RESULTS: Data from 28 of 34 participants were used in the data analysis. 
Creatinine-adjusted urinary cotinine concentrations increased up to 13-fold and 
peaked 4-h after completed exposure (range of adjusted geometric means 
[AGMs] = 0.352-2.31 μg/g creatinine). Salivary cotinine concentrations were also 
the highest 4-h after completed exposure (range of AGMs = 0.0373-0.167 ng/mL). 
Salivary cotinine and creatinine-corrected concentrations of urinary cotinine, 
trans-3'-hydroxycotinine, CEMA, and 3-HPMA varied significantly across sampling 
times. Urinary and salivary cotinine, urinary trans-3'-hydroxycotinine, and 
urinary 3-HPMA concentrations also varied significantly across events.
CONCLUSION: Secondhand e-cigarette exposures lasting six hours resulted in 
significant changes in exposure biomarker concentrations of both nicotine and 
acrolein but did not change exposure to tobacco-specific nitrosamines. 
Additional research is needed to understand the relationship between biomarker 
concentrations and environmental concentrations of toxicants in e-cigarette 
emissions.

INTRODUCTION: Electronic cigarettes (ECIGs) aerosolize a liquid that usually 
contains propylene glycol and/or vegetable glycerin, flavorants, and the 
dependence-producing drug nicotine in various concentrations. This study 
examined the extent to which ECIG liquid nicotine concentration is related to 
user plasma nicotine concentration in ECIG-naïve tobacco cigarette smokers.
METHODS: Sixteen ECIG-naïve cigarette smokers completed four laboratory sessions 
that differed by the nicotine concentration of the liquid (0, 8, 18, or 36 
mg/ml) that was placed into a 1.5 Ohm, dual coil "cartomizer" powered by a 3.3V 
battery. In each session, participants completed two, 10-puff ECIG use bouts 
with a 30-second inter-puff interval; bouts were separated by 60 minutes. Venous 
blood was sampled before and after bouts for later analysis of plasma nicotine 
concentration; puff duration, volume, and average flow rate were measured during 
each bout.
RESULTS: In bout 1, relative to the 0mg/ml nicotine condition (mean = 3.8 ng/ml, 
SD = 3.3), plasma nicotine concentration increased significantly immediately 
after the bout for the 8 (mean = 8.8 ng/ml, SD = 6.3), 18 (mean = 13.2 ng/ml, SD 
= 13.2), and 36 mg/ml (mean = 17.0 ng/ml, SD = 17.9) liquid concentration. A 
similar pattern was observed after bout 2. Average puff duration in the 36 mg/ml 
condition was significantly shorter compared to the 0mg/ml nicotine condition. 
Puff volume increased during the second bout for 8 and 18 mg/ml conditions.
CONCLUSIONS: For a given ECIG device, nicotine delivery may be directly related 
to liquid concentration. ECIG-naïve cigarette smokers can, from their first use 
bout, attain cigarette-like nicotine delivery profiles with some currently 
available ECIG products.
IMPLICATIONS: Liquid nicotine concentration can influence plasma nicotine 
concentration in ECIG-naïve cigarette smokers, and, at some concentrations, the 
nicotine delivery profile of a 3.3V ECIG with a dual coil, 1.5-Ohm cartomizer 
approaches that of a combustible tobacco cigarette in this population. Finding a 
product that delivers nicotine as effectively as a tobacco cigarette, as we 
report here, may be essential for smokers who want to replace completely their 
combustible tobacco cigarettes with ECIGs.

Electronic cigarette (EC) use is gaining popularity as a substitute for 
conventional smoking due to the perception and evidence it represents a safer 
alternative. In contrast to the common perception amongst users that ECs 
represent no risk initial studies have revealed a complex composition of 
e-cigarette liquids. Conventional cigarette smoking is a known risk factor for 
developing bladder cancer and prior reports raise concern some of those 
causative compounds may exist in EC liquids or vapor. Urine samples were 
collected from 13 e-cigarette using subjects and 10 non e-cigarette using 
controls. Five known bladder carcinogens that are either present in conventional 
cigarettes, products of combustion, or solvents believed to be used in some 
e-cigarette formulations were quantified by liquid chromatography - mass 
spectrometry (LC-MS). Analysis of e-cigarette user urine revealed the presence 
of two carcinogenic compounds, o-toluidine and 2-naphthylamine, at a mean 2.3 
and 1.3 fold higher concentration (p-value of 0.0013 and 0.014 respectively). 
Many of these subjects (9/13) were long term nonsmokers (>12 months). Further 
study is needed to clarify the safety profile of e-cigarettes and their 
contribution to the development of bladder cancer given the greater 
concentration of carcinogenic aromatic amines in the urine of e-cigarette users.

Data from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey for 2013-2016 were 
used to compare observed levels of cadmium, lead, and total mercury in blood 
among US residents aged ≥12 years who were users of cigars, cigarettes, cigars 
and cigarettes, e-cigarettes and dual users of cigarettes and e-cigarettes. 
Total sample size available for analysis was 1139. Adjusted geometric means 
(AGM) among cigarette, cigar, e-cigarette, cigarette and cigar, and 
cigarette-e-cigarette users were comparable for blood cadmium lead, and total 
mercury. Cigar only users had lower AGM than cigar and cigarette users for total 
mercury (0.56 vs. 0.97 μg/L, p = 0.03). There is no evidence yet that can show 
concentrations of blood and urine cadmium, lead, and mercury among e-cigarette 
users are any different than among cigarette and/or dual users of cigarettes and 
e-cigarettes.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Recent surveys confirm continued increases in the use 
of electronic-cigarettes (e-cigarettes) in adolescents and adults. Users often 
state that e-cigarettes reduce tobacco craving and withdrawal symptoms in 
addition to their smoking. Data from laboratory studies and clinical trials have 
confirmed these statements, though there are inconsistencies in the outcomes. In 
this pilot study, we set out to evaluate the effects of e-cigarettes, as 
compared to the participants' own cigarettes, on baseline craving and smoking 
severity.
METHODS: Using a within-subjects, placebo-controlled study design, 15 
tobacco-dependent, e-cigarette naïve participants sustained abstinence 
overnight. They completed distinct phases of this protocol during four separate 
study sessions. Participants were randomized to an e-cigarette device containing 
one of three doses of nicotine (0, 18, or 36 mg/ml) or their own cigarette. Each 
study visit was ~3 hours long and separated by at least 7 days. Visits included 
assessments of craving and smoking severity.
RESULTS: The data showed that after 10 puffs in both the Own cigarette and 
e-cigarette conditions, breath carbon monoxide levels increased significantly in 
the former but not the latter. Questionnaire of Smoking Urges and Choices to 
Smoke scores were not statistically different across groups after two distinct 
bouts of 10 puffs each. Additionally, E-cigarette Perceptions Questionnaire 
responses were not significantly different according to dose.
CONCLUSION AND SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: This experiment provides data 
demonstrating that e-cigarettes did not reduce craving or smoking severity in 
e-cigarette naïve users. However, since this was a pilot study, the conclusions 
that can be drawn are limited. (Am J Addict 2019;28:361-366).

This study assessed changes in biomarkers of exposure (BoE) after 5 days of 
completely or partially switching to an electronic nicotine delivery system 
(ENDS) use, compared with continued use of combustible cigarettes and smoking 
abstinence among Chinese adult smokers. A randomized, open-label, parallel-arm 
study was conducted among Chinese adult smokers who were naive ENDS users. 
Forty-six subjects were randomized to 4 study groups (n = 11-12 per group): 
exclusive ENDS use, dual use of ENDS and cigarettes, exclusive cigarettes use, 
and smoking abstinence. Subjects were confined in clinic for 5 consecutive days 
and product use was ad libitum. Nicotine and its metabolites (cotinine and 
3-hydroxycotinine), and BoEs (AAMA, CEMA, HEMA, HMPMA, 3-HPMA, SPMA, exhaled CO, 
and exhaled NO) were measured. Withdrawal symptom was measured using MNWS 
throughout the 5-day period. Six urine BoEs of volatile organic compounds 
decreased by 55.1-84.1% in the exclusive ENDS use group, which is similar to the 
smoking abstinence group (67.2-87.4%). The level of decrease was 56.8-70.4% in 
the dual use group and 10.7-39.0% in the cigarettes group. Urine total nicotine 
exposure had a non-significant increase in the exclusive ENDS use group, and 
plasma nicotine and cotinine showed a trend of increasing day by day. After 
completely or partially switching to ENDS use among Chinese smokers, exposure to 
selected toxicants were significantly decreased. The results of this study add 
to the body of evidence that exposure to toxic substance decreased among smokers 
after complete or partial switch from combustible cigarettes to ENDS use. As 
part of transition to experienced ENDS use, this study found that smokers of the 
initial stage who have no prior ENDS experience may increase nicotine intake 
after switching to ENDS use.

RATIONALE: Adolescent exposure to ∆9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the 
psychotropic constituent of cannabis, might affect brain development, and in 
rodent models leads to long-term behavioral and physiological alterations. Yet, 
the basic pharmacology of this drug in adolescent rodents, especially when 
ingested via ecologically relevant routes like aerosol inhalation, commonly 
referred to as "vaping," is still poorly characterized. Moreover, sex 
differences exist in THC metabolism, kinetics, and behavioral effects, but these 
have not been rigorously examined after vapor dosing in adolescents.
OBJECTIVES: We investigated the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 
aerosolized THC (30 min inhalation exposure, 25 or 100 mg/ml) in adolescent 
Wistar rats of both sexes.
METHODS: Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis of THC and its major 
metabolites was conducted on blood plasma and brain tissue at 5, 30, 60, and 
120 min following a 30-min aerosol dosing session. Effects on activity in a 
novel environment for 120 min after aerosol, and temperature, were measured in 
separate rats.
RESULTS: We found sex-dependent differences in the pharmacokinetics of THC and 
its active (11-OH-THC) and inactive (11-COOH-THC) metabolites in the blood and 
brain, along with dose- and sex-dependent effects on anxiety-like and 
exploratory behaviors; namely, greater 11-OH-THC levels accompanied by greater 
behavioral effects in females at the low dose but similar hypothermic effects in 
both sexes at the high dose.
CONCLUSIONS: These results provide a benchmark for dosing adolescent rats with 
aerosolized (or "vaped") THC, which could facilitate adoption by other labs of 
this potentially human-relevant THC exposure model to understand cannabis 
effects on the developing brain.

BACKGROUND: Cigarette smoking remains one of the leading public health threats 
worldwide. Electronic cigarettes (e-cigs) provide an alternative to conventional 
cigarette smoking; however, the evidence base of risks and benefits of e-cig use 
is new and growing. In this cross-sectional pilot study, the effect of e-cig use 
on biological profiles in saliva and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) was 
assessed and compared with the profiles of cigarette smokers (CS), dual users, 
and non-users. The systemic inflammatory mediators between e-cig users (EC) and 
these other groups were also assessed.
METHODS: This pilot cross-sectional study recruited volunteer participants 
consisting of four groups, non-smokers (NS), CS, EC, and dual EC and cigarette 
smokers (DS). Saliva and GCF samples were collected and analyzed for biomarkers 
of inflammation, oxidative stress, anti-inflammatory lipid mediators, tissue 
injury and repair, and growth factors with immunoassay (enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay and Luminex).
RESULTS: Smoking status was confirmed via salivary cotinine. Prostaglandin E2 
level was significantly increased in CS compared with EC and DS, but not 
significantly different in EC and DS groups compared with non-smokers (NS). 
Statistically significant differences were observed between groups of EC and NS 
(myeloperoxidase [MPO], matrix metalloproteinase-9) as well as between DS and EC 
for biomarkers of inflammatory mediators (receptor for advanced glycation end 
products [RAGE], MPO, uteroglobin/CC-10); between groups of DS and NS for 
extracellular newly identified RAGE binding protein and between CS and NS for 
MPO. No statistically significant differences in biomarkers of immunity (S100A8, 
S100A9, galectin-3), tissue injury and repair (Serpine1/PAI-1) and growth 
factors (brain-derived neurotrophic factor, fibroblast growth factors, 
platelet-derived growth factor-AA, vascular endothelial growth factor, and 
others) were found between any of groups.
CONCLUSION: Statistically significant differences in measurable health outcomes 
were found between different smoking status groups, suggesting that 
smoking/vaping produces differential effects on oral health.

BACKGROUND: To assess the abuse liability of the JUUL System (JS) in 5.0 % (59 
mg/mL) and 3.0 % (35 mg/mL) nicotine concentrations.
METHODS: Adult smokers (N = 146; 45.9 % female; mean age = 41.29 years) were 
randomized to one of four study flavor arms and then to a within-subjects 
cross-over sequence for five test product categories: (1) JS 5.0 % nicotine 
concentration; (2) JS 3.0 % nicotine; (3) usual brand (UB) cigarette; (4) 4 mg 
mint nicotine gum; (5) comparator ENDS (VUSE Alto 5.0 % nicotine). Products were 
tested by ad libitum use (5 min for ENDS and cigarette; 30 min for gum); 
nicotine pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters and subjective effects were assessed 
following use.
RESULTS: Maximum plasma nicotine concentration (Cmax-BL), rate of plasma 
nicotine rise and total nicotine exposure (AUC0-60-BL) of UB cigarette were 
significantly greater than all other test products. The comparator ENDS was 
significantly greater than 5.0 % and 3.0 % JS and nicotine gum on Cmax-BL, rate 
of plasma nicotine rise, and AUC0-60-BL; Cmax-BL of JS 5.0 % was significantly 
greater than JS 3.0 % and nicotine gum. Product liking and satisfying effects 
were significantly highest for the UB cigarette; JS products and comparator ENDS 
did not significantly differ and were rated higher than nicotine gum on most 
subjective measures.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the abuse liability of both 5.0 % and 
3.0 % JS is: (1) substantially lower than UB cigarette; (2) somewhat lower than 
comparator ENDS; and (3) higher than nicotine gum. Additionally, the abuse 
liability of JS 5.0 % is somewhat higher than JS 3.0 %.

INTRODUCTION: Limited research exists about the possible cardiovascular effects 
of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS). We therefore sought to compare 
exposure to known or potentially cardiotoxic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) 
in ENDS users, smokers, and dual users.
METHODS: A total of 371 individuals from the Cardiovascular Injury due to 
Tobacco Use study, a cross-sectional study of healthy participants aged 21-45 
years, were categorized as nonusers of tobacco (n = 87), sole ENDS users (n = 
17), cigarette smokers (n = 237), and dual users (n = 30) based on 30-day 
self-reported tobacco product use patterns. Participants provided urine samples 
for VOC and nicotine metabolite measurement. We assessed associations between 
tobacco product use and VOC metabolite measures using multivariable-adjusted 
linear regression models.
RESULTS: Mean (SD) age of the population was 32 (±6.8) years, 55% men. Mean 
urinary cotinine level in nonusers of tobacco was 2.6 ng/mg creatinine, whereas 
cotinine levels were similar across all tobacco product use categories 
(851.6-910.9 ng/mg creatinine). In multivariable-adjusted models, sole ENDS 
users had higher levels of metabolites of acrolein, acrylamide, acrylonitrile, 
and xylene compared with nonusers of tobacco, but lower levels of most VOC 
metabolites compared with cigarette smokers or dual users. In direct comparison 
of cigarettes smokers and dual users, we found lower levels of metabolites of 
styrene and xylene in dual users.
CONCLUSION: Although sole ENDS use may be associated with lower VOC exposure 
compared to cigarette smoking, further study is required to determine the 
potential health effects of the higher levels of certain reactive aldehydes, 
including acrolein, in ENDS users compared with nonusers of tobacco.
IMPLICATIONS: ENDS use in conjunction with other tobacco products may not 
significantly reduce exposure to VOC, but sole use does generally reduce some 
VOC exposure and warrants more in-depth studies.

AIMS: To compare the effects of (i) high versus low nicotine concentration 
e-liquid, (ii) fixed versus adjustable power and (iii) the interaction between 
the two on: (a) vaping behaviour, (b) subjective effects, (c) nicotine intake 
and (d) exposure to acrolein and formaldehyde in e-cigarette users vaping in 
their everyday setting.
DESIGN: Counterbalanced, repeated measures with four conditions: (i) low 
nicotine (6 mg/ml)/fixed power; (ii) low nicotine/adjustable power; (iii) high 
nicotine (18 mg/ml)/fixed power; and (iv) high nicotine/adjustable power.
SETTING: London and the South East, England.
PARTICIPANTS: Twenty experienced e-cigarette users (recruited between September 
2016 and February 2017) vaped ad libitum using an eVic Supreme™ with a 'Nautilus 
Aspire' tank over 4 weeks (1 week per condition).
MEASUREMENTS: Puffing patterns [daily puff number (PN), puff duration (PD), 
interpuff interval (IPI)], ml of e-liquid consumed, changes to power (where 
permitted) and subjective effects (urge to vape, nicotine withdrawal symptoms) 
were measured in each condition. Nicotine intake was measured via salivary 
cotinine. 3-Hydroxypropylmercapturic acid (3-HPMA), a metabolite of the toxicant 
acrolein, and formate, a metabolite of the carcinogen formaldehyde, were 
measured in urine.
FINDINGS: There was a significant nicotine concentration × power interaction for 
PD (P < 0.01). PD was longer with low nicotine/fixed power compared with (i) 
high nicotine/fixed power (P < 0.001) and (ii) low nicotine/adjustable power 
(P < 0.01). PN and liquid consumed were higher in the low versus high nicotine 
condition (main effect of nicotine, P < 0.05). Urge to vape and withdrawal 
symptoms were lower, and nicotine intake was higher, in the high nicotine 
condition (main effects of nicotine: P < 0.01). While acrolein levels did not 
differ, there was a significant nicotine × power interaction for formaldehyde 
(P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Use of a lower nicotine concentration e-liquid may be associated 
with compensatory behaviour (e.g. higher number and duration of puffs) and 
increases in negative affect, urge to vape and formaldehyde exposure.

Sanità, Rome, Italy.

BACKGROUND: Tobacco cigarette smoke (TCS) was previously demonstrated to affect 
the innate and adaptive immune responses as a consequence of oxidant generation 
which play a pivotal role in neutrophilic airway inflammation. Aim of this paper 
was to investigate whether electronic cigarette smoke (ECS) generates reactive 
oxygen species (ROS) similarly to cigarette smoke.
METHOD: By means of a house made apparatus, ECS and TCS were collected in fetal 
bovine serum (FBS) which was used to grow immune cells isolated from rats. As 
index of oxidative products nitrite, superoxide, and thiobarbituric 
acid-reactive substances (TBARS) were determined in the medium before and after 
cell growth.
RESULTS: The results showed that: i) ECS caused a remarkable increase of 
nitrites and TBARS although in lesser extension than TCS; ii) the spleen and 
lymph node cells grown in ECS and TCS-exposed medium were able to reduce TBARS 
but not nitrites present in the medium; iii) PBMC in TCS-exposed medium were 
able to reduce nitrites and TBARS more efficiently than spleen and lymph node 
cells, but released more superoxide anion; iv) TCS and ECS not influence the 
PBMC and spleen T cell subtype populations (CD4+, CD8+).
CONCLUSIONS: As ECS nicotine-free gave the same results of unexposed medium, we 
can support the hypothesis that the increase of ROS in ECS exposed medium was 
prevalently due to nicotine.

The exposure to smoking related products has been evaluated through urine 
illness risk marker determination through the analysis of urine samples of 
smokers and vapers. Biomarkers and their metabolites such as 
N-acetyl-S-(2-cyanoethyl)-L-cysteine (CEMA), 
N-acetyl-S-(3,4-dihydroxybutyl)-L-cysteine (DHBMA), 
N-acetyl-S-[1-(hydroxymethyl)-2-propen-1-yl)-L-cysteine (MHBMA), 
N-acetyl-S-(3-hydroxypropyl)-L-cysteine (3HPMA), 
2R-N-acetyl-S-(4-hydroxybutan-2-yl)-L-cysteine (HMPMA), and 
N-acetyl-S-(3-carboxy-2-propyl)-L-cysteine (CMEMA) together with nicotine and 
cotinine were identified and quantified by LC-HRMS and LC-MS/MS, and data found 
normalized to the creatinine level. One hundred two urine samples were collected 
from smokers, non-smokers, and vapers, spanning an age range from 16 to 79 
years. Results obtained showed that CEMA was only detected in urine samples from 
smokers and MHBMA was in the same order of magnitude in all the urine samples 
analyzed. HMPMA was found in the urine of vapers at the same order of 
concentration as in non-smokers. 3HPMA in vapers was lower than in the urine of 
smokers, presenting an intermediate situation between smokers and non-smokers. 
On the other hand, DHBMA in vapers can reach similar values to those found for 
smokers, while CMEMA shows concentrations in the urine of vapers higher than in 
the case of non-smokers and traditional smokers, requiring new research to link 
this metabolite to the use of electronic cigarettes and possible alternative 
metabolomic routes. In general, this study seems to verify that traditional 
smoking practice constitutes a major source of carcinogenic chemicals compared 
with substitutive practices, although those practices are not free of potential 
harm.

Arabia. ishamwagg30@hotmail.com.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this research is to discover a link between cigarette 
smoking and decreased red cell CD47 expression.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The current cross-sectional study included 72 smokers (who 
had smoked 20 cigarettes per day for at least two years) and 50 nonsmokers, as 
well as nonsmokers who had not been exposed to smokers on a regular basis and 
chose to participate as controls. Due to exclusion criteria, 11 participants 
were removed from the study; they had various genetic, immune, and metabolic 
disorders, leaving only 61 healthy people in the study. A flow cytometer was 
used to examine CD47.
RESULTS: There was a strong correlation between smoking and a decrease in CD47 
markers in all types of smokers in the control samples (p-value = 0.000), as 
well as among cigarette smokers only (p-value = 0.000), cigarette and Shisha 
smokers (p-value = 0.024), and cigarette and e-cigarette smokers (p-value = 
0.014). Furthermore, there is a strong correlation between the appearance of the 
CD47 marker in healthy smokers and smokers with non-hereditary blood diseases 
like iron deficiency anemia and polycythemia.
CONCLUSIONS: It can be concluded that smoking significantly reduces the 
expression of the CD47 marker.

Cannabis use through smoking, vaping, or ingestion is increasing, but only 
limited studies have investigated the resulting exposure to harmful chemicals. 
N-acetyl-S-(2-cyanoethyl)-L-cysteine (2CYEMA), a urinary metabolite of 
acrylonitrile, a possible carcinogen, is elevated in the urine of past-30-day 
cannabis users compared to non-cannabis users. Five frequent and five occasional 
cannabis users smoked and vaped cannabis on separate days; one also consumed 
cannabis orally. Urine samples were collected before and up to 72 h post dose 
and urinary 2CYEMA was quantified. We compared 2CYEMA pre-exposure levels, 
maximum concentration, time at maximum concentration for occasional versus 
frequent users following different exposure routes, and measured half-life of 
elimination. Smoking cannabis joints rapidly (within 10 min) increased 2CYEMA in 
the urine of occasional cannabis users, but not in frequent users. Urine 2CYEMA 
did not consistently increase following vaping or ingestion in either study 
group. Cigarette smokers had high pre-exposure concentrations of 2CYEMA. 
Following cannabis smoking, the half-lives of 2CYEMA ranged from 2.5 to 9.0 h. 
2CYEMA is an effective biomarker of cannabis smoke exposure, including smoke 
from a single cannabis joint, however, not from vaping or when consumed orally. 
When using 2CYEMA to evaluate exposure in cannabis users, investigators should 
collect the details about tobacco smoking, route of consumption, and time since 
last use as possible covariates.

BACKGROUND: Smoking is frequently a way to control appetite and weight. The data 
concerning the body mass gain after quitting among the users of electronic 
cigarettes who have no prior history of smoking traditional cigarettes is 
inconsistent.
OBJECTIVE: In our study we have compared smoking and vaping impact on weight 
gain and glycaemia.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: 3 groups of rats were used. The group A was exposed to 
vapour and group B were exposed to smoke. Rats in the group C constituted the 
control group without nicotine exposition.
RESULTS: During 6 weeks of experiment weight gain of rats in the A and B groups 
was comparable, while animals from group C had gained signifi0cantly more. 
During 2 weeks after cessation of exposition to nicotine animals from group B 
gained more weight than rats of A and C group. Blood glucose was higher in group 
B than in groups A and C 24 h after last exposure to nicotine and 2 weeks after 
nicotine exposure cessation.
CONCLUSION: Effects of vaping on weight increase is similar to smoking, but 
after vaping cassation weight gain is lower and comparable with nicotine 
nonusers.

IMPORTANCE: Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) have gained unprecedented 
popularity, but virtually nothing is known about their cardiovascular risks.
OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that an imbalance of cardiac autonomic tone 
and increased systemic oxidative stress and inflammation are detectable in 
otherwise healthy humans who habitually use e-cigarettes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional case-control study of 
habitual e-cigarette users and nonuser control individuals from 2015 to 2016 at 
the University of California, Los Angeles. Otherwise healthy habitual 
e-cigarette users between the ages of 21 and 45 years meeting study criteria, 
including no current tobacco cigarette smoking and no known health problems or 
prescription medications, were eligible for enrollment. Healthy volunteers 
meeting these inclusion criteria who were not e-cigarette users were eligible to 
be enrolled as control individuals. A total of 42 participants meeting these 
criteria were enrolled in the study including 23 self-identified habitual 
e-cigarette users and 19 self-identified non-tobacco cigarette, non-e-cigarette 
user control participants.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Heart rate variability components were analyzed for 
the high-frequency component (0.15-0.4 Hz), an indicator of vagal activity, the 
low-frequency component (0.04-0.15 Hz), a mixture of both vagal and sympathetic 
activity, and the ratio of the low frequency to high frequency, reflecting the 
cardiac sympathovagal balance. Three parameters of oxidative stress were 
measured in plasma: (1) low-density lipoprotein oxidizability, (2) high-density 
lipoprotein antioxidant/anti-inflammatory capacity, and (3) paraoxonase-1 
activity.
RESULTS: Of the 42 participants, 35% were women, 35% were white, and the mean 
age was 27.6 years. The high-frequency component was significantly decreased in 
the e-cigarette users compared with nonuser control participants (mean [SEM], 
46.5 [3.7] nu vs 57.8 [3.6] nu; P = .04). The low-frequency component (mean 
[SEM], 52.7 [4.0] nu vs 39.9 [3.8] nu; P = .03) and the low frequency to high 
frequency ratio (mean [SEM], 1.37 [0.19] vs 0.85 [0.18]; P = .05) were 
significantly increased in the e-cigarette users compared with nonuser control 
participants, consistent with sympathetic predominance. Low-density lipoprotein 
oxidizability, indicative of the susceptibility of apolipoprotein B-containing 
lipoproteins to oxidation, was significantly increased in e-cigarette users 
compared with nonuser control individuals (mean [SEM], 3801.0 [415.7] U vs 
2413.3 [325.0] U; P = .01) consistent with increased oxidative stress, but 
differences in high-density antioxidant/anti-inflammatory capacity and 
paraoxonase-1 activity were not significant.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, habitual e-cigarette use was 
associated with a shift in cardiac autonomic balance toward sympathetic 
predominance and increased oxidative stress, both associated with increased 
cardiovascular risk.

The goal of our study was to assess acute respiratory responses to using 
e-cigarettes in exclusive e-cigarette users (E-Group) and dual users (T/E-Group) 
and to compare these effects with responses to smoking tobacco-cigarettes in 
tobacco smokers (T-Group). The study included 120 adults (age: 21.7 ± 2.1 years) 
divided into 4 groups (n = 30 each): Controls, T-, E-, T/E-Group. Spirometric 
status, O2 saturation, exhaled FeNO levels, exhaled CO levels, and airway 
temperature were assessed before the use of an e-cigarette (E-, T/E-Group) or 
tobacco cigarette as well as 'minute 1' and 'minute 30' after smoking. Controls 
used an e-cigarette without e-liquid. Lower (p < 0.05) baseline values of FeNO 
were found in T-Group (15.4 ppb) and in T/E-Group (15.0 ppb) than in Controls 
(19.6 ppb). Following exposure, and compared with Controls, T-, and T/E-Group 
had a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in PEF and MEF75. Mean FeNO values 
decreased on 'minute 1' in T-Group (by 2.1 ppb), E-Group (by 1.5 ppb) and in 
T/E-Group (by 2.2 ppb). Other effects included increase in temperature of 
exhaled air (p < 0.05). The use of e-cigarettes is associated with decreased 
FeNO and airflow indices (PEF, MEF75), but an increase in airway temperature. 
These changes are similar to those after exposure to tobacco cigarette smoke.

BACKGROUND: Passive exposure to the aerosols of electronic cigarettes 
(e-cigarettes) has been little studied. We assessed this exposure in late 
pregnancy in a woman and her 3-year-old child, exposed through e-cigarette use 
by another household member.
METHODS: This prospective longitudinal case study involved a family unit 
consisting of an e-cigarette user, a pregnant woman who delivered an infant 
during the study, and the couple's older 3-year-old son. At 31, 36, and 40 weeks 
of the pregnancy, we measured biomarkers (nicotine metabolites, tobacco-specific 
nitrosamines, propanediols, glycerol, and metals) in the urine and hair of all 
three participants and in the saliva of the adults, in cord blood at delivery, 
and in the breast milk at the postpartum period.
RESULTS: Samples from the e-cigarette user showed quantifiable concentrations of 
all analytes assessed (maximum urinary cotinine concentration, 4.9 ng/mL). Among 
samples taken from the mother, nicotine and its metabolites were found mainly in 
urine and also in saliva and hair, but not in cord blood. During the postpartum 
period, we found cotinine concentrations of 2.2 ng/mL in the mother's urine and 
0.22 ng/mL in breast milk; 1,2-propanediol was generally detected in urine and 
saliva, but not in cord blood or breast milk. The maximum urinary cotinine 
concentration in the 3-year-old child was 2.6 ng/mL and propanediols also were 
detected in his urine. Nitrosamines were not detected in samples taken from the 
mother or the 3-year-old. Metals found in the refill liquid were detected at low 
levels in both the mother and the 3-year-old.
CONCLUSIONS: We detected low but not negligible concentrations of 
e-cigarette-related analytes (including cord blood and breast milk) in an 
exposed pregnant non-user and in a 3-year-old child also living in the home. 
Passive exposure to e-cigarette aerosols cannot be disregarded and should be 
assessed in larger observational studies.

Electronic cigarette (ECIG) nicotine delivery and other effects may depend on 
liquid nicotine concentration and user experience. This study is the first to 
systematically examine the influence of ECIG liquid nicotine concentration and 
user experience on nicotine delivery, heart rate, puff topography, and 
subjective effects. Thirty-three ECIG-experienced individuals and 31 ECIG-naïve 
cigarette smokers completed 4 laboratory conditions consisting of 2, 10-puff 
bouts (30-sec interpuff interval) with a 3.3-V ECIG battery attached to a 1.5-Ω 
"cartomizer" (7.3 W) filled with 1 ml ECIG liquid. Conditions differed by liquid 
nicotine concentration: 0, 8, 18, or 36 mg/ml. Participants' plasma nicotine 
concentration was directly related to liquid nicotine concentration and 
dependent on user experience, with significantly higher mean plasma nicotine 
increases observed in ECIG-experienced individuals relative to ECIG-naïve 
smokers in each active nicotine condition. When using 36 mg/ml, mean plasma 
nicotine increase for ECIG-experienced individuals was 17.9 ng/ml (SD = 17.2) 
and 6.9 (SD = 7.1; p < .05) for ECIG-naïve individuals. Between-group 
differences were likely due to longer puffs taken by experienced ECIG users: 
collapsed across condition, mean puff duration was 5.6 sec (SD = 3.0) for 
ECIG-experienced and 2.9 (SD = 1.5) for ECIG-naïve individuals. ECIG use also 
suppressed nicotine/tobacco abstinence symptoms in both groups; the magnitude of 
abstinence symptom suppression depended on liquid nicotine concentration and 
user experience. These and other recent results suggest that policies intended 
to limit ECIG nicotine delivery will need to account for factors in addition to 
liquid nicotine concentration (e.g., device power and user behavior). (PsycINFO

The health and safety of using e-cigarette products (vaping) have been 
challenging to assess and further regulate due to their complexity. Inhaled 
e-cigarette aerosols contain chemicals with under-recognized toxicological 
profiles, which could influence endogenous processes once inhaled. We urgently 
need more understanding on the metabolic effects of e-cigarette exposure and how 
they compare to combustible cigarettes. To date, the metabolic landscape of 
inhaled e-cigarette aerosols, including chemicals originated from vaping and 
perturbed endogenous metabolites in vapers, is poorly characterized. To better 
understand the metabolic landscape and potential health consequences of vaping, 
we applied liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) based nontargeted 
metabolomics to analyze compounds in the urine of vapers, cigarette smokers, and 
nonusers. Urine from vapers (n = 34), smokers (n = 38), and nonusers (n = 45) 
was collected for verified LC-HRMS nontargeted chemical analysis. The altered 
features (839, 396, and 426 when compared smoker and control, vaper and control, 
and smoker and vaper, respectively) among exposure groups were deciphered for 
their structural identities, chemical similarities, and biochemical 
relationships. Chemicals originating from e-cigarettes and altered endogenous 
metabolites were characterized. There were similar levels of nicotine biomarkers 
of exposure among vapers and smokers. Vapers had higher urinary levels of 
diethyl phthalate and flavoring agents (e.g., delta-decalactone). The metabolic 
profiles featured clusters of acylcarnitines and fatty acid derivatives. More 
consistent trends of elevated acylcarnitines and acylglycines in vapers were 
observed, which may suggest higher lipid peroxidation. Our approach in 
monitoring shifts of the urinary chemical landscape captured distinctive 
alterations resulting from vaping. Our results suggest similar nicotine 
metabolites in vapers and cigarette smokers. Acylcarnitines are biomarkers of 
inflammatory status and fatty acid oxidation, which were dysregulated in vapers. 
With higher lipid peroxidation, radical-forming flavoring, and higher level of 
specific nitrosamine, we observed a trend of elevated cancer-related biomarkers 
in vapers as well. Together, these data present a comprehensive profiling of 
urinary biochemicals that were dysregulated due to vaping.

The nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR), a genetically informed biomarker of rate of 
nicotine metabolism, has been validated as a tool to select the optimal 
treatment for individual smokers, thereby improving treatment outcomes. This 
review summarizes the evidence supporting the development of the NMR as a 
biomarker of individual differences in nicotine metabolism, the relationship 
between the NMR and smoking behavior, the clinical utility of using the NMR to 
personalize treatments for smoking cessation, and the potential mechanisms that 
underlie the relationship between NMR and smoking cessation. We conclude with a 
call for additional research necessary to determine the ultimate benefits of 
using the NMR to personalize treatments for smoking cessation. These future 
directions include measurement and other methodologic considerations, 
disseminating this approach to at-risk subpopulations, expanding the NMR to 
evaluate its efficacy in predicting treatment responses to e-cigarettes and 
other noncigarette forms of nicotine, and implementation science including 
cost-effectiveness analyses.See all articles in this Special Collection Honoring

Resting state functional brain connectivity (rsFC) may be an important 
neuromarker of smoking behavior. Prior research has shown, among cigarette 
smokers, that nicotine administration alters rsFC within frontal and parietal 
cortices involved in executive control, as well as striatal regions that drive 
reward processing. These changes in rsFC have been associated with reductions in 
withdrawal symptom severity. We currently have a limited understanding of how 
rsFC is affected by the use of electronic cigarettes (ecigs), an increasingly 
popular class of products, the members of which deliver nicotine with varying 
effectiveness. The current study used fMRI to determine the effects of ecig use 
on rsFC and withdrawal symptoms. Independent component, dual regression, and 
permutation analyses were conducted on rsFC collected from ecig users before and 
after an ecig use episode (n=9) that occurred after 14h of nicotine abstinence. 
Similar to the known effects of nicotine administration, ecig use decreased rsFC 
of two clusters in the right frontal pole and frontal medial cortex with an 
attentional control salience network, and decreased rsFC of five clusters in the 
left thalamus, insula, and brain stem with a reward network encompassing the 
striatum. Ecig use increased inverse coupling between the prefrontal reward 
network and the right frontoparietal executive control network. Reductions in 
craving and difficulty with concentration were correlated with decreases in 
coupling strength between reward and executive control networks. These 
preliminary results suggest that the effects of ecig use on rsFC are similar to 
those seen with nicotine administration in other forms. In order to gain insight 
into the addictive potential of ecigs, further research is needed to understand 
the neural influence of ecigs across the range of nicotine delivery within this 
class of products.

BACKGROUND: Contrary to intuition, use of lower strength nicotine e-liquids 
might not offer reduced health risk if compensatory puffing behaviour occurs. 
Compensatory puffing (e.g. more frequent, longer puffs) or user behaviour 
(increasing the wattage) can lead to higher temperatures at which glycerine and 
propylene glycol (solvents used in e-liquids) undergo decomposition to carbonyl 
compounds, including the carcinogens formaldehyde and acetaldehyde. This study 
aims to document puffing patterns and user behaviour associated with using high 
and low strength nicotine e-liquid and associated toxicant/carcinogen exposure 
in experienced e-cigarette users (known as vapers herein).
METHODS/DESIGN: A counterbalanced repeated measures design.
PARTICIPANTS: Non-tobacco smoking vapers; have used an e-cigarette for ≥3 
months; currently using nicotine strength e-liquid ≥12mg/mL and a second or 
third generation device.
INTERVENTION: This study will measure puffing patterns in vapers whilst they use 
high and low strength nicotine e-liquid under fixed and user-defined settings, 
each for a week. The 4 counterbalanced conditions are: i) low strength (6mg/mL), 
fixed settings; ii) low strength user-defined settings; iii) high strength 
(18mg/mL) fixed settings; iv) high strength user-defined settings. Biomarkers of 
exposure to toxicants and carcinogens will be measured in urine. In the second 
phase of this study, toxicant yields will be measured in aerosol generated using 
a smoking machine operated to replicate the puffing behaviours of each 
participant.
PRIMARY OUTCOMES: i) Puffing patterns (mean puff number, puff duration, 
inter-puff interval and mL of liquid consumed) and user behaviour (changes to 
device settings: voltage and air-flow) associated with using high and low 
strength nicotine e-liquid. ii) Toxicant/carcinogen exposure associated with the 
puffing patterns/device settings used by our participants.
SECONDARY OUTCOMES: i) Subjective effects. ii) comparisons with toxicant 
exposure from tobacco smoke (using documented evidence) and with recommended 
safety limits.
SAMPLE SIZE: Twenty participants.
DISCUSSION: The findings will have important implications for public health 
messaging regarding the relative risks and subjective effects associated with 
using high and low strength nicotine e-liquid, and for policy makers regarding 
regulations on nicotine concentrations in e-liquids.

INTRODUCTION: Real-world evidence regarding likely long-term health effects of 
e-vapor products (EVP) under actual use conditions relative to cigarette smoking 
is not well studied.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional, observational study, biomarkers of exposure 
(BOE) to select harmful and potentially harmful constituents and biomarkers of 
potential harm (BOPH) relevant to smoking-related diseases were measured in 
exclusive adult EVP users (AEVP, n = 144) and exclusive adult cigarette smokers 
(AS, n = 73). AEVP used their own brand of EVP for 6+ months following 10+ years 
of cigarette smoking and AS smoked own brand of cigarettes for 10+ years. 
Subject recruitment and informed consent were obtained online and urine/blood 
samples were collected at local clinical laboratories, representing a new 
paradigm for collecting real-world evidence.
RESULTS: The levels of total NNAL (NNK metabolite), 3-hydroxypropyl mercapturic 
acid (acrolein metabolite), and carboxyhemoglobin (carbon monoxide measure) were 
46% to 86% lower in AEVP compared with AS (p ≤ .0001) as was nicotine 
equivalents (nicotine and its five metabolites; 36%, p < .01). The levels of 
some BOPH were significantly lower in AEVP compared with AS for 
11-dehydrothromboxane-B2 (29%, p = .04; platelet activation), 
8-epi-prostaglandin F2α (23%, p = .02; oxidative stress) and soluble 
intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (16%, p = .02; endothelial function).
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the feasibility of a new approach for 
collecting real-world evidence. Substantially lower levels of BOEs (NNK, 
nicotine, acrolein, carbon monoxide) and favorable differences in BOPHs 
(platelet activation, oxidative stress, endothelial function) suggest EVP users 
may have lower health risks than cigarette smokers.
IMPLICATIONS: Cigarette smoking causes serious diseases. Switching from a 
combustible tobacco product to a noncombustible product is a potential harm 
reduction pathway for adult smokers unable or unwilling to quit. Real-world 
evidence regarding the relative risk of EVP use compared with cigarettes is not 
well established. This study provides data specific to BOE to tobacco smoke 
constituents and biomarkers of potential harm collected under actual use 
conditions in a real-world setting. The totality of evidence suggests that 
exclusive EVP use may present lower health risk compared with smoking 
cigarettes.

Electronic cigarettes (E-cigarettes) have become popular as substitutes for 
conventional tobacco cigarettes or to aid quitting, but little is known about 
the potential risks to cardiovascular health for smokers and nonsmokers. We 
sought to compare the impact of E-cigarettes with conventional cigarettes on 
platelet function in healthy adult smokers and nonsmokers. A crossover 
single-blind study in 40 healthy participants (20 smokers, 20 nonsmokers, 
matched for age and sex) was conducted. Each participant smoked a conventional 
cigarette then returned 1 week later to vape a study E-cigarette with the same 
nominal nicotine content. Blood samples were drawn shortly before and 5 minutes 
after each episode and analyzed for platelet aggregation, soluble CD40-ligand 
(sCD40L) and soluble P-selectin (sP-selectin). At baseline, smokers had 
significantly higher levels of sCD40L and sP-selectin (all p ≤0.01) than 
nonsmokers. Within 5 minutes of using either a conventional cigarette or 
E-cigarette, changes in the levels of sCD40L, sP-selectin, and platelet 
aggregation (all p ≤0.01) were detectable in both smokers and nonsmokers. In 
smokers, there were no significant changes in sCD40L and sP-selectin but there 
was a significant increase in platelet aggregation. In nonsmokers, there was a 
significant increase in all markers of platelet activation following both 
cigarette and E-cigarette use. Both traditional and E-cigarettes have short-term 
effects on platelet activation, although in nonsmokers the use of E-cigarettes 
had a less important impact. In conclusion, we provide the first comparison data 
of the acute impact of Tobacco-cigarette and E-cigarette smoking on the platelet 
function in smokers and nonsmokers.

BACKGROUND: Nicotine, the pharmacologically active substance in both tobacco and 
many electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) liquids, is responsible for the 
addiction that sustains cigarette smoking. With 8 million deaths worldwide 
annually, smoking remains one of the major causes of disability and premature 
death. However, nicotine also plays an important role in smoking cessation 
strategies.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to develop a comprehensive, whole-body, 
physiologically based pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PBPK/PD) model of 
nicotine and its major metabolite cotinine, covering various routes of nicotine 
administration, and to simulate nicotine brain tissue concentrations after the 
use of combustible cigarettes, e-cigarettes, nicotine gums, and nicotine 
patches.
METHODS: A parent-metabolite, PBPK/PD model of nicotine for a non-smoking and a 
smoking population was developed using 91 plasma and brain tissue 
concentration-time profiles and 11 heart rate profiles. Among others, cytochrome 
P450 (CYP) 2A6 and 2B6 enzymes were implemented, including kinetics for CYP2A6 
poor metabolizers.
RESULTS: The model is able to precisely describe and predict both nicotine 
plasma and brain tissue concentrations, cotinine plasma concentrations, and 
heart rate profiles. 100% of the predicted area under the concentration-time 
curve (AUC) and maximum concentration (Cmax) values meet the twofold acceptance 
criterion with overall geometric mean fold errors of 1.12 and 1.15, 
respectively. The administration of combustible cigarettes, e-cigarettes, 
nicotine patches, and nicotine gums was successfully implemented in the model 
and used to identify differences in steady-state nicotine brain tissue 
concentration patterns.
CONCLUSIONS: Our PBPK/PD model may be helpful in further investigations of 
nicotine dependence and smoking cessation strategies. As the model represents 
the first nicotine PBPK/PD model predicting nicotine concentration and heart 
rate profiles after the use of e-cigarettes, it could also contribute to a 
better understanding of the recent increase in youth e-cigarette use.

BACKGROUND: Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) have experienced a tremendous 
increase in use. Unlike cigarette smoking, the effects of e-cigarettes and their 
constituents on mediating vascular health remain understudied. However, given 
their increasing popularity, it is imperative to evaluate the health risks of 
e-cigarettes, including the effects of their ingredients, especially nicotine 
and flavorings.
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of flavored 
e-cigarette liquids (e-liquids) and serum isolated from e-cigarette users on 
endothelial health and endothelial cell-dependent macrophage activation.
METHODS: Human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived endothelial cells 
(iPSC-ECs) and a high-throughput screening approach were used to assess 
endothelial integrity following exposure to 6 different e-liquids with varying 
nicotine concentrations and to serum from e-cigarette users.
RESULTS: The cytotoxicity of the e-liquids varied considerably, with the 
cinnamon-flavored product being most potent and leading to significantly 
decreased cell viability, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, 
caspase 3/7 activity, and low-density lipoprotein uptake, activation of 
oxidative stress-related pathway, and impaired tube formation and migration, 
confirming endothelial dysfunction. Upon exposure of ECs to e-liquid, 
conditioned media induced macrophage polarization into a pro-inflammatory state, 
eliciting the production of interleukin-1β and -6, leading to increased ROS. 
After exposure of human iPSC-ECs to serum of e-cigarette users, increased ROS 
linked to endothelial dysfunction was observed, as indicated by impaired 
pro-angiogenic properties. There was also an observed increase in inflammatory 
cytokine expression in the serum of e-cigarette users.
CONCLUSIONS: Acute exposure to flavored e-liquids or e-cigarette use exacerbates 
endothelial dysfunction, which often precedes cardiovascular diseases.

INTRODUCTION: Many American Indian communities have a high prevalence of smoking 
and e-cigarette use, but factors associated with their dual use are rarely 
studied.
METHODS: In 2016, a total of 375 American Indian adults who smoke completed 
paper surveys regarding cigarette and e-cigarette use and provided saliva for 
cotinine levels. In 2018, cross-sectional analyses were performed, comparing 
dual users (12%), defined as using e-cigarettes on some or every day for the 
past 30 days, with never users of e-cigarettes (37%).
RESULTS: Compared with never users, dual users were younger, more often reported 
history of depression (56% and 29%, respectively; p<0.01) and family history of 
smoking-related disease (77% and 59%, respectively; p<0.05), had lower harm 
perceptions of e-cigarettes (27% and 47%, respectively; p<0.01) or vapor (14% 
and 35%, respectively; p<0.01), and more often perceived e-cigarettes as 
cessation aids (75% and 16%, respectively; p<0.01) and as less harmful than 
cigarettes (70% and 17%, respectively; p<0.01). Dual users were less often 
uncertain/unknowing about e-cigarette benefits or harms (p<0.01) and more often 
reported likelihood to quit smoking (49% and 24%, respectively; p<0.01) and 
prior attempt to quit smoking, ever (89% and 67%, respectively; p<0.01) or in 
the past year (55% and 32%, respectively; p=0.01). Cigarette consumption and 
cotinine levels did not differ between groups. Dual users more often tried other 
nicotine products (p<0.02) and more often lived with a vaping partner/spouse 
(45% and 6%, respectively; p<0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Dual users perceived e-cigarettes as less harmful than cigarettes 
and more as cessation aids than cigarette-only users did, but cigarette 
consumption did not differ between groups. Whether e-cigarettes will reduce 
smoking-related disparities among American Indian people remains undetermined.

INTRODUCTION: An important basis for risk estimation for e-cigarette (e-cig) 
users is a well-founded dosimetry. The objective of this study was to assess the 
applicability of stable-isotope e-liquid ingredients for exposure studies in 
vapers.
METHODS: E-cigs with 10% of labeled propylene glycol (PG), glycerol (G), and 
nicotine was used by 20 experienced vapers under controlled (Part A) and free 
(Part B) conditions. In Part A, 10 subjects vaped at 10 W and another 10 
subjects at 18 W power setting of the e-cig. In Part B, the same subjects used 
the same product ad libitum in their usual environment. Five smokers, smoking 10 
non-filter cigarettes, spiked with labeled PG, G, and nicotine, served as 
positive control during Part A. PG, G, nicotine and its metabolites were 
measured in plasma, urine, and saliva.
RESULTS: Peak nicotine levels (sum of measured labeled and unlabeled) in plasma 
were lower in vapers (15.8 to 19.6 ng/mL) than in smokers (36 ng/mL). The 
labeled plasma nicotine levels were ten times lower than the unlabeled, 
reflecting the ratio in the e-liquid. PG levels in plasma and urine also 
reflected the vaping activities in Part A, while G in these body fluids showed 
no association with vaping.
CONCLUSIONS: This proof of concept study shows that the application of labeled 
e-liquid ingredients allows the accurate quantification of the dose of nicotine 
and PG when other nicotine and tobacco products were used simultaneously. 
Unchanged G was not assessable by this approach.
IMPLICATIONS: This approach allows the investigations of the absorption of 
potential PG-, G-, and nicotine-derived vapor constituents (eg, aldehydes and 
epoxides) by vaping. Appropriate studies are in progress in our laboratory.

INTRODUCTION: Pod Vaping Devices (PVD) such as JUUL have become extremely 
popular in the United States although their uptake and use in the United Kingdom 
remain lower. A key difference between the United States and the United Kingdom 
is the nicotine strength legally permitted, typically 59 mg/mL in the United 
States but capped at 20 mg/mL in the United Kingdom and European Union. This may 
limit the ability of EU vaping devices to deliver satisfactory nicotine levels. 
The primary aim was to compare the EU- (18 mg/mL nicotine strength) with the 
U.S.-JUUL (59 mg/mL) on daily smokers' subjective experiences, craving relief, 
and blood nicotine levels.
AIMS AND METHODS: Double-blind, counterbalanced within-participants design with 
two conditions: 18 mg/mL versus 59 mg/mL. On two separate occasions, UK smokers 
(N =19, 10 males, 9 females) vaped ad libitum for 60 mins and provided blood 
samples at baseline 5, 15, 30, and 60 min. Subjective effects (incl. 
satisfaction) were measured at 10 and 60 min and, craving and withdrawal 
symptoms (WS) at baseline, 10 and 60 min.
RESULTS: Satisfaction did not differ between conditions. There was a significant 
interaction between Time and Nicotine concentration for Nicotine Hit (p = .045). 
Mean self-report of Nicotine Hit increased under the use of the 59 mg/mL from 10 
to 60 min and decreased under the 18 mg/mL. Participants reported higher Throat 
Hits following use of the 59 mg/mL (p = .017). There were no differences in 
other subjective effects including craving, WS relief (ps > .05). Liquid 
consumption was doubled under the 18 versus the 59 mg/mL (p = .001) and nicotine 
boost was significantly higher in the 59 mg/mL at all time-points (p ≤ .001).
CONCLUSIONS: The results did not support our hypotheses that satisfaction, 
craving, and withdrawal reduction would be higher with the 59 mg/mL JUUL. This 
could be because of the doubling of liquid consumption in the 18 mg/mL. Whether 
satisfaction and craving relief persist over the longer-term outside of the lab 
remains to be determined.
IMPLICATIONS: In a 60-min ad-lib vaping session, the EU-JUUL was found to 
produce comparable satisfaction, craving- and withdrawal relief as the U.S.-JUUL 
in this sample of UK smokers. These findings could suggest that the higher 
nicotine concentrations available in PVDs in the United States are not necessary 
for providing satisfaction and improving craving and WS. However, this was at 
the expense of a considerable increase in liquid consumption indicative of 
compensatory puffing.

BACKGROUND: This randomized, partially single-blinded, 6-period crossover 
clinical study of adult smokers compared the nicotine pharmacokinetics, impacts 
on smoking urge and tolerability of various formulations of one brand of 
e-cigarettes with that of a tobacco cigarette.
METHODS: Five e-cigarettes with different e-liquid formulations containing 1.6 % 
and 2.4 % nicotine and a conventional tobacco cigarette were randomized among 24 
subjects under two exposure sessions consisting of a 30-min controlled and a 
one-hour ad lib use period to assess plasma nicotine levels, impacts on smoking 
urge and adverse events. The 30-min controlled use session comprised an 
intensive use of the e-cigarettes with a total of 50 puffs taken every 30 s for 
comparison to a single conventional cigarette having a typical machine-measured 
nicotine yield (~0.8 mg). Ad lib product use conditions provided insight into 
more naturalistic product use behaviors and their accompanying smoking urge 
reductions. Adverse events (AEs) were assessed by the Principal Investigator.
RESULTS: Significant (p < 0.05) increases in plasma nicotine concentrations 
occurred within 10 min of controlled e-cigarette use and significant (p < 0.001) 
reductions from baseline smoking urge were observed within 5 min. E-cigarette 
and cigarette nicotine plasma levels were comparable for up to one hour of use. 
After both sessions (90 min), nicotine exposure was the highest for the 
cigarette, with all e-cigarettes showing 23 % to 53 % lower plasma 
concentrations. During controlled use, peak reduction in smoking urge for e-cigs 
occurred later than for the cigarette. After completion of both sessions, 
significant smoking urge reduction persisted for most of the tested 
e-cigarettes, albeit at levels lower than that provided by the tobacco 
cigarette. Nicotine content, vehicle differences, and the presence of menthol 
did not significantly affect smoking urge reduction by the e-cigarettes. No 
subjects were discontinued due to AEs. The most frequently reported AEs events 
included cough, throat irritation, headache, and dizziness.
CONCLUSIONS: Blood plasma nicotine levels obtained from short-term use of 
e-cigarettes containing 1.6 % and 2.4 % nicotine were significant, but lower 
than those of conventional tobacco cigarettes, yet the reduction in craving 
symptoms were broadly comparable. The types of AEs were consistent with other 
research studies of longer duration that have reported that use of e-cigarettes 
by adult smokers is well-tolerated.

Recently published in vitro and in vivo findings strongly suggest that BBB 
impairment and increased risk for stroke by tobacco smoke (TS) closely resemble 
that of type-2 diabetes (2DM) and develop largely in response to common key 
modulators such oxidative stress (OS), inflammation and alterations of the 
endogenous antioxidative response system (ARE) regulated by the nuclear factor 
erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2). Preclinical studies have also shown that 
nicotine (the principal e-liquid's ingredient used in e-cigarettes) can also 
cause OS, exacerbation of cerebral ischemia and secondary brain injury. Herein 
we provide evidence that likewise to TS, chronic e-Cigarette (e-Cig) vaping can 
be prodromal to the loss of blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity and vascular 
inflammation as well as act as a promoting factor for the onset of stroke and 
worsening of post-ischemic brain injury. In addition, recent reports have shown 
that Metformin (MF) treatment before and after ischemic injury reduces stress 
and inhibits inflammatory responses. Recent published data by our group 
revealead that MF promotes the activation of counteractive mechanisms mediated 
by the activation of Nrf2 which drastically reduce TS toxicity at the brain and 
cerebrovascular levels and protect BBB integrity. In this study we provide 
additional in vivo evidence showing that MF can effectively reduce the oxidative 
and inflammatory risk for stroke and attenuate post-ischemic brain injury 
promoted by TS and e-Cig vaping. Our data also suggest that MF administration 
could be extended as prophylactic care during the time window required for the 
renormalization of the risk levels of stroke following smoking cessation thus 
further studies in that direction are warrated.

OBJECTIVES: Describe clinical characteristics of adolescents hospitalized with 
e-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury (EVALI) and to 
investigate association between EVALI and coagulopathy.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adolescents admitted to 
the general inpatient or ICUs at 2 major tertiary children's hospitals from 
January 2019 to June 2021. We included analysis of demographics, clinical 
findings, laboratory and imaging results, and outcomes.
RESULTS: Forty-four hospitalizations met diagnostic criteria for inclusion per 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, with 55% of patients 
admitted after April 2020. Compared with adults, pediatric patients were less 
likely to present with pulmonary symptoms. Significant laboratory work included 
elevated white blood cell count of 14.3 k/uL (confidence interval [CI], 
13.7-15.0) with neutrophilic predominance, C-reactive protein of 25.2 mg/dL (CI, 
22.1-28.2), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 66.7 mm/hour (CI, 26.9-76.4). 
Chest radiographs were poor predictors of disease in 53% of our patients but 
computed tomography was 100% sensitive. Significant coagulation abnormalities 
included prothrombin time of 17.7 seconds (CI, 16.4-19.1) and international 
normalized ratio of 1.54 (CI, 1.43-1.66). Coagulation studies improved with 
vitamin K and steroid administration. Nine of 16 patients (56%) had abnormal 
diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide divided by alveolar volume 
<80% predicted, suggesting evidence of pulmonary vascular disease, or >100%, 
suggesting pulmonary hemorrhage.
CONCLUSIONS: EVALI continues to be an important differential diagnosis in the 
adolescent population. EVALI is likely a result of systemic inflammation with 
consequences beyond the pulmonary system. The novel report of coagulopathy among 
adolescents with EVALI in this cohort reveals an opportunity to detect 
coagulopathy and initiate early therapy.

BACKGROUND: Tobacco use is the single largest preventable risk factor for 
premature death of non-communicable diseases and the second leading cause of 
cardiovascular disease. In response to the harmful effects of tobacco smoking, 
the use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) has emerged and gained 
significant popularity over the past 15 years. E-cigarettes are promoted as safe 
alternatives for traditional tobacco smoking and are often suggested as a way to 
reduce or quit smoking. However, evidence suggests they are not harmless.
DISCUSSION: The rapid evolution of the e-cigarette market has outpaced the 
legislator's regulatory capacity, leading to mixed regulations. The increasing 
use of e-cigarettes in adolescents and young individuals is of concern. While 
the long-term direct cardiovascular effects of e-cigarettes remain largely 
unknown, the existing evidence suggests that the e-cigarette should not be 
regarded as a cardiovascular safe product. The contribution of e-cigarette use 
to reducing conventional cigarette use and smoking cessation is complex, and the 
impact of e-cigarette use on long-term cessation lacks sufficient evidence.
CONCLUSION: This position paper describes the evidence regarding the prevalence 
of e-cigarette smoking, uptake of e-cigarettes in the young, related 
legislations, cardiovascular effects of e-cigarettes and the impact of 
e-cigarettes on smoking cessation. Knowledge gaps in the field are also 
highlighted. The recommendations from the population science and public health 
section of the European Association of Preventive Cardiology are presented.

BACKGROUND: In American Indian (AI) tobacco users from the southern plains 
region of the US, we examined the relationship between nicotine and carcinogen 
exposure and nicotine metabolism.
METHODS: Smokers (n = 27), electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) users 
(n = 21), and dual users (n = 25) of AI descent were recruited from a southern 
plains state. Urinary biomarkers of nicotine metabolism (nicotine metabolite 
ratio [NMR]), nicotine dose (total nicotine equivalents [TNE]), and a 
tobacco-specific lung carcinogen (4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol 
and its glucuronides [total NNAL] were measured.
RESULTS: The geometric mean of NMR was 3.35 (95% Confidence Interval(CI): 2.42, 
4.65), 4.67 (95% CI: 3.39, 6.43), and 3.26 (95% CI: 2.44, 4.37) among smokers, 
ENDS users, and dual users. Each of the three user groups had relatively low 
levels of TNE, indicative of light tobacco use. Among smokers, there were 
inverse relationships between NMR and TNE (r = -0.45) and between NMR and NNAL 
(r = -0.50). Among dual users, NMR and TNE, and NMR and NNAL were not 
associated. Among ENDS users, NMR and TNE were not associated.
CONCLUSIONS: AI tobacco users with higher NMR did not have higher TNE or NNAL 
exposure than those with lower NMR. This supports prior work among light tobacco 
users who do not alter their tobacco consumption to account for nicotine 
metabolism.
IMPACT: The high prevalences of smoking and ENDS among AI in the southern plains 
may not be related to nicotine metabolism. Environmental and social cues may 
play a more important role in light tobacco users and this may be particularly 
true among AI light tobacco users who have strong cultural ties.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Vaporized nicotine products (VNPs) can vary in important 
characteristics including size, shape, flavor and nicotine yield. We examined 
whether complex interactions among these characteristics could affect smokers' 
VNP perceptions and usage patterns.
DESIGN: A within-subject randomized cross-over trial.
SETTING: Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Buffalo, NY, USA.
PARTICIPANTS: Eighteen daily cigarette smokers.
MEASUREMENTS: Participants attended eight weekly visits during which they 
sampled six different VNPs (disposable, rechargeable, eGO, mod, e-Cigar and 
e-Pipe) with tobacco-flavored e-liquid. Prior to device use, participants 
completed product-ranking questionnaires. Participants completed controlled 
puffing sessions during each of the six trials, after which satisfaction 
questionnaires were completed and blood samples were taken.
FINDINGS: Initial perceptions showed that the smallest device (disposable) was 
ranked as safer compared with a larger device (e-Pipe) (P < 0.05). Participants 
rated the eGO and mod devices higher on satisfaction and enjoyment from use, 
taste, pleasantness, harshness ('throat hit') and speed of effect, but lower on 
perceived health risk and embarrassment from use (P < 0.05). All devices had a 
lower Cmax than the combustible cigarette (P < 0.05), but there were differences 
among devices (P < 0.05). The mod, e-Pipe and eGO provided the highest amount of 
perceived smoking urge relief, and this correlated strongly with Cmax across all 
devices (R2  = 0.8614, P = 0.007). The perceived speed of urge relief was not 
correlated with Tmax (R2  = 0.0035, P = 0.911) CONCLUSIONS: Daily cigarette 
smokers testing six types of vaporized nicotine products (VNPs) reported that 
they varied in taste, amount of withdrawal relief, harshness, embarrassment from 
use, perceived health risk and subjective and objective nicotine delivery. The 
eGO and mod models have properties that may make them most effective for 
cigarette substitution among smokers who intend to switch to a VNP.

Many harmful and potentially harmful constituents are present in tobacco 
products. Cigarette smoke is known to cause different forms of cancer and 
trigger the development of chronic diseases. In the last decade, electronic 
cigarettes have emerged as a healthier alternative associated to less harmful 
effects in comparison to traditional tobacco. However, the lack of 
standardization of electronic cigarettes products makes it difficult to 
establish and compare the real effects on health of products from different 
manufacturers. To better understand the impact of smoking and vaping, the 
volatomic composition of urine samples from traditional tobacco smokers and 
electronic cigarette users was established and compared with nonsmokers (control 
group), using headspace solid-phase microextraction combined with gas 
chromatography-mass spectrometry. A total of 45 urinary volatile organic 
metabolites belonging to different chemical families were identified in the 
urine of the studied groups. Benzene derivatives, terpenes, and aromatics were 
the chemical families that contributed the most to the urinary profile of 
smokers. The vapers urinary volatomic pattern was also dominated by terpenes and 
aromatics, in addition to alcohols. The orthogonal partial least 
squares-discriminant analysis of the data obtained indicated that the urinary 
profile of vapers is more closely related to the control group, reinforcing the 
hypothesis of the lowest harmfulness of electronic cigarettes. Further studies 
recruiting a higher number of subjects are therefore necessary to consolidate 
the data obtained.

Despite the perception that e-cigarettes are safer than conventional cigarettes, 
numerous findings demonstrated that e-cigarette aerosol (EC) exposure induced 
compromised immune functionality, vascular changes even after acute exposure, 
and lung injury. Notably, altered neutrophil functionality and platelet 
hemodynamics have been observed post-EC exposure. It was hypothesized that EC 
exposure initiates an inflammatory response resulting in altered neutrophil 
behavior and increased neutrophil-platelet interaction in the pulmonary 
microvasculature. Neutrophil and platelet responses were examined up to 48 hrs 
following whole-body, short-term EC exposure without flavorants or nicotine in a 
murine model, which most closely modeled secondhand exposure. This study is the 
first to investigate the impact of EC exposure through lung intravital imaging. 
Compared to room air-exposed mice, EC-exposed mice displayed significantly 
increased 1.7‒1.9-fold number of neutrophils in the pulmonary microvasculature 
associated with no marked change in neutrophils within whole blood or 
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Neutrophil-platelet interactions were also 
significantly elevated 1.9‒2.5-fold in exposed mice. Plasma concentration of 
myeloperoxidase was markedly reduced 1.5-fold 48 hr following exposure 
cessation, suggesting suppressed neutrophil antimicrobial activity. Cytokine 
expression exhibited changes indicating vascular damage. Effects persisted for 
48 hr post-EC exposure. Data demonstrated that EC exposure repeated for 3 
consecutive days in 2.5 hr intervals in the absence of flavorants or nicotine 
resulted in modified pulmonary vasculature hemodynamics, altered immune 
functionality, and a pro-inflammatory state in female BALB/cJ mice.

INTRODUCTION: Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are rapidly increasing in 
popularity but little information is available on their potential toxic or 
carcinogenic effects.
METHODS: Twenty-eight e-cigarette smokers who had not smoked tobacco cigarettes 
for at least 2 months provided urine samples which were analyzed by validated 
methods for a suite of toxicant and carcinogen metabolites including 
1-hydroxypyrene (1-HOP), 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol and its 
glucuronides (total NNAL), 3-hydroxypropylmercapturic acid (3-HPMA), 
2-hydroxypropylmercapturic acid (2-HPMA), 3-hydroxy-1-methylpropylmercapturic 
acid (HMPMA), S-phenylmercapturic acid (SPMA), nicotine, and cotinine. Levels of 
these compounds were compared to those found in cigarette smokers from three 
previous studies.
RESULTS: Levels of 1-HOP, total NNAL, 3-HPMA, 2-HPMA, HMPMA, and SPMA were 
significantly lower in the urine of e-cigarette users compared to cigarette 
smokers. Levels of nicotine and cotinine were significantly lower in e-cigarette 
users compared to cigarette smokers in one study but not in another.
CONCLUSIONS: With respect to the compounds analyzed here, e-cigarettes have a 
more favorable toxicity profile than tobacco cigarettes.

Evidence suggests exposure of nicotine-containing e-cigarette aerosol to 
nonusers leads to systemic absorption of nicotine. However, no studies have 
examined acute secondhand exposures that occur in public settings. Here, we 
measured the serum, saliva and urine of nonusers pre- and post-exposure to 
nicotine via e-cigarette aerosol. Secondarily, we recorded factors affecting the 
exposure. Six nonusers of nicotine-containing products were exposed to 
secondhand aerosol from ad libitum e-cigarette use by three e-cigarette users 
for 2 h during two separate sessions (disposables, tank-style). Pre-exposure 
(baseline) and post-exposure peak levels (Cmax) of cotinine were measured in 
nonusers' serum, saliva, and urine over a 6-hour follow-up, plus a saliva sample 
the following morning. We also measured solution consumption, nicotine 
concentration, and pH, along with use behavior. Baseline cotinine levels were 
higher than typical for the US population (median serum session 
one = 0.089 ng/ml; session two = 0.052 ng/ml). Systemic absorption of nicotine 
occurred in nonusers with baselines indicative of no/low tobacco exposure, but 
not in nonusers with elevated baselines. Median changes in cotinine for 
disposable exposure were 0.007 ng/ml serum, 0.033 ng/ml saliva, and 0.316 ng/mg 
creatinine in urine. For tank-style exposure they were 0.041 ng/ml serum, 
0.060 ng/ml saliva, and 0.948 ng/mg creatinine in urine. Finally, we measured 
substantial differences in solution nicotine concentrations, pH, use behavior 
and consumption. Our data show that although exposures may vary considerably, 
nonusers can systemically absorb nicotine following acute exposure to secondhand 
e-cigarette aerosol. This can particularly affect sensitive subpopulations, such 
as children and women of reproductive age.

BACKGROUND: The liquids (e-liquids) used in an electronic cigarette 
(e-cigarette) contain myriad chemicals without adequate human inhalation safety 
data. Furthermore, the absence of e-liquid labeling requirements poses a 
formidable challenge to understanding how e-liquid constituents may promote 
nicotine addiction and/or have independent or synergistic biological effects 
when combined with nicotine. Ethyl alcohol is such a constituent, but has 
received little scientific interest in this context.
METHODS: Using a randomized, double blind, crossover design, acute changes in 
subjective drug effects, motor performance and biochemical measures of alcohol 
and nicotine intake were evaluated after directed and ad lib puffing from two 
commercially available e-liquids containing nicotine (8 mg/ml), vanilla flavor 
and either 23.5% (high) or 0.4% (trace) alcohol.
RESULTS: While no differences in subjective drug effects were observed between 
alcohol conditions, performance on the Purdue Pegboard Dexterity Test (PPDT) 
improved under the trace, but not under the 23.5% alcohol condition. Although 
plasma alcohol levels remained undetectable during testing, urine ethyl 
glucuronide (EtG), an alcohol metabolite, became measurable in three 
participants after puffing from the 23.5% alcohol e-cigarette.
CONCLUSIONS: Brief use of a widely available type of e-cigarette containing an 
e-liquid purchased from an internet vendor can negatively impact psychomotor 
performance and in some instances, produce detectable levels of a urine alcohol 
metabolite. Given the widespread and unregulated use of e-cigarettes, especially 
by youth and other vulnerable populations, further studies are needed to 
evaluate both the acute safety and long-term health risks of using 
alcohol-containing e-cigarettes.

AIMS: Little is known about features of e-cigarettes (EC) that facilitate or 
hinder the switch from smoking to vaping. We tested eight brands of EC to 
determine how nicotine delivery and other product characteristics influence 
user's initial reactions.
METHODS: Fifteen vapers tested each product after overnight abstinence from both 
smoking and vaping. At each session, participant's vaped ad lib for 5 min. Blood 
samples were taken at baseline and at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 30 min after starting 
vaping. Participants rated the products on a range of characteristics. The 
products tested included six 'cig-a-like' and two refillable products, one with 
variable voltage. We also tested participants' own EC.
RESULTS: All products significantly reduced urges to smoke. Refillable products 
delivered more nicotine and received generally superior ratings in terms of 
craving relief, subjective nicotine delivery, throat hit and vapour production 
but in overall ratings, they were joined by a cig-a-like, Blu. Participants 
puffed more on low nicotine delivery products. Participants' estimates of 
nicotine delivery from different EC were closely linked to 'throat hit'. 
Nicotine delivery was less important in the initial product ratings than draw 
resistance, mouthpiece comfort and effects on reducing urge to smoke.
CONCLUSIONS: All EC products reduced urges to smoke. Refillable products 
received generally more favourable ratings than 'cig-a-likes' with similar 
nicotine content. Perception of nicotine delivery was guided by throat 
sensations. Lower nicotine delivery was associated with more frequent puffing. 
The first impressions of EC products are guided less by nicotine delivery than 
by sensory signals.

Smokers who switch completely to e-cigarettes may reduce their relative risk of 
tobacco-related disease. Effective nicotine delivery from e-cigarettes is 
important in consumer acceptance. We assessed whether protonated nicotine and 
e-cigarette devices delivering greater aerosol mass increase nicotine delivery 
and product liking. A randomised controlled non-blinded eight-arm crossover 
study was used to assess plasma nicotine pharmacokinetics and product liking for 
two e-cigarettes (Vype ePen3 and Vype ePen) with various nicotine e-liquid 
formulations and a conventional cigarette among 24 healthy dual-users of 
cigarettes and e-cigarettes. Product use and puff count were also assessed. 
Results show that nicotine bioavailability was greater for Vype ePen3 with 
greater aerosol mass delivery than for Vype ePen (Cmax, p = 0.0073; 
AUC0-120 min, p = 0.0102). Protonated nicotine (18 mg/mL, medium protonation) 
e-liquid yielded higher nicotine bioavailability than unprotonated nicotine 
(18 mg/mL) e-liquid (Cmax, p = 0.0001; AUC0-120 min, p = 0.0026). There was no 
significant difference in Tmax between e-liquids. Nicotine bioavailability did 
not differ between nicotine benzoate formulation (30 mg/mL nicotine, high 
protonation) and combustible cigarettes (Cmax, p = 0.79; AUC0-120 min, 
p = 0.13). Vype ePen3 with protonated nicotine delivers nicotine more 
efficiently with the potential to increase product liking relative to earlier 
devices using unprotonated e-liquid.

Vaping is a fairly new and legal way young people are inhaling substances into 
their lungs. Very little is currently known about the immediate physiological 
impact or the psychosocial reasons surrounding vape use. This study used a mixed 
methods approach to (a) understand the short-term physiological implications of 
vape use compared with people who do not vape and (b) investigate the reasons 
people choose to vape compared with those who choose not to vape. Twenty-four 
people participated in the study: 12 self-identified as nonvapers, and 12 
self-identified as people who vape. All participants were between 18 and 24 
years old. Qualitative analysis suggested people vape because they think it is 
cool, think it is less risky than smoking, and enjoy the social aspects of 
vaping. People who choose not to vape are concerned about the unknown health 
implications, think it is a waste of resources, and are apathetic toward it. 
Quantitative results revealed statistically significant increases in heart rate 
and decreases in the percentage of blood oxygenation after 20 minutes of vape 
use. Blood pressure, respiratory rate, and blood sugar scores did not 
significantly change after 20 minutes of vape use. Differences in the 
frequencies of men and women across the two groups were found. Significant 
differences found for systolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, and pulmonary 
function test became nonsignificant after controlling for gender. Both long- and 
short-term effects of vaping need to be further evaluated. The psychosocial 
reasons why certain people vape whereas others in the same peer group do not 
also need to be better understood.

Monocytes exhibiting a pro-inflammatory phenotype play a key role in adhesion 
and development of atherosclerotic plaques. As an alternative to smoking, 
next-generation tobacco and nicotine products (NGP) are now widely used. 
However, little is known about their pro-inflammatory effects on monocytes. We 
investigated cell viability, anti-oxidant and pro-inflammatory gene and protein 
expression in THP-1 monocytes after exposure to aqueous smoke extracts (AqE) of 
a heated tobacco product (HTP), an electronic cigarette (e-cig), a conventional 
cigarette (3R4F) and pure nicotine (nic). Treatment with 3R4F reduced cell 
viability in a dose-dependent manner, whereas exposure to alternative smoking 
products showed no difference to control. At the highest non-lethal dose of 3R4F 
(20%), the following notable mRNA expression changes were observed for 3R4F, 
HTP, and e-cig respectively, relative to control; HMOX1 (6-fold, < 2-fold, < 
2-fold), NQO1 (3.5-fold, < 2-fold, < 2-fold), CCL2 (4-fold, 3.5-fold, 2.5-fold), 
IL1B (4-fold, 3-fold, < 2-fold), IL8 (5-fold, 2-fold, 2-fold), TNF (2-fold, 
2-fold, < 2-fold) and ICAM1 was below the 2-fold threshold for all products. 
With respect to protein expression, IL1B (3-fold, < 2-fold, < 2-fold) and IL8 
(3.5-fold, 2-fold, 2-fold) were elevated over the 2-fold threshold, whereas 
CCL2, TNF, and ICAM1 were below 2-fold expression for all products. At higher 
doses, greater inductions were observed with all extracts; however, NGP 
responses were typically lower than 3R4F. In conclusion, anti-oxidative and 
pro-inflammatory processes were activated by all products. NGPs overall showed 
lower responses relative to controls than THP-1 cells exposed to 3R4F AqE.

OBJECTIVES: The aim was to investigate the effects of nicotine on neutrophil 
extracellular traps (NETs) formation in current and non-smokers and on a murine 
model of RA.
METHODS: We compared spontaneous and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced 
NETosis between current and non-smokers by DNA release binding. Nicotine-induced 
NETosis from non-smokers was assessed by DNA release binding, NET-specific 
(myeloperoxidase (MPO)-DNA complex) ELISA and real-time fluorescence microscopy. 
We also used immunofluorescent staining to detect nicotinic acetylcholine 
receptors (nAChRs) on neutrophils and performed a functional analysis to assess 
the role of nAChRs in nicotine-induced NETosis. Finally, we investigated the 
effects of systemic nicotine exposure on arthritis severity and NETosis in the 
CIA mouse model.
RESULTS: Neutrophils derived from current smokers displayed elevated levels of 
spontaneous and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced NETosis. Nicotine 
induced dose-dependent NETosis in ex vivo neutrophils from healthy non-smokers, 
and co-incubation with ACPA-immune complexes or TNF-α facilitated a synergistic 
effect on NETosis. Real-time fluorescence microscopy revealed robust formation 
of NET-like structures in nicotine-exposed neutrophils. Immunofluorescent 
staining demonstrated the presence of the α7 subunit of the nAChR on 
neutrophils. Stimulation of neutrophils with an α7-specific nAChR agonist 
induced NETosis, whereas pretreatment with an nAChR antagonist attenuated 
nicotine-induced NETosis. Nicotine administration to mice with CIA exacerbated 
inflammatory arthritis, with higher plasma levels of NET-associated MPO-DNA 
complex.
CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that nicotine is a potent inducer of NETosis, which 
may play an important role in accelerating arthritis in the CIA model. This 
study generates awareness of and the mechanisms by which nicotine-containing 
products, including e-cigarettes, may have deleterious effects on patients with 
RA.

INTRODUCTION: Reducing exposure to cigarette smoke is an imperative for public 
health and for patients with diabetes. Increasingly, combustion-free nicotine 
delivery systems (C-F NDS) such as e-cigarettes and heated tobacco products are 
substituting conventional cigarettes and accelerating the downward trends in 
smoking prevalence. However, there is limited information about the long-term 
health impact in patients with diabetes who use C-F NDS. This randomised trial 
of type 2 diabetic cigarette smokers will test the hypothesis that following a 
switch from conventional cigarettes to C-F NDS a measurable improvement in 
metabolic syndrome (MetS) factors will be shown over the course of 2 years.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study is multicentre and thus will take place in five 
locations in four countries in an ambulatory setting. A total of 576 patients 
with diabetes will be randomised (1:2 ratio) to either a control arm (Study Arm 
A), in which they will be offered referral to smoking cessation programmes or to 
an intervention arm (Study Arm B) assigned to C-F NDS use. Participants will be 
at least 23 years old and of any gender. Patient recruitment will start in 
February 2021 and is expected to be completed by December 2021. Primary outcome 
measures include fasting plasma glucose, blood pressure, triglycerides, 
high-density lipoprotein and waist circumference, while secondary feature 
absolute change in the sum of the individual factors of MetS and change in each 
individual factor of MetS measured at each study time point.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The approval of research ethics committee (REC) 
regarding the trial protocol, informed consent forms and other relevant 
documents is required to commence the study. Substantial amendments to the study 
protocol cannot be implemented until the REC grants a favourable opinion. The 
results of the study are intended to be published as articles in high quality 
peer-reviewed journals and disseminated through conference papers.

PURPOSE: Cigarette smoking is a risk factor for developing nonmuscle invasive 
bladder cancer, and continued smoking exposure after diagnosis may increase the 
likelihood of adverse clinical outcomes. We compare self-reported vs 
biochemically verified nicotine exposure to determine the accuracy of 
self-report among recently diagnosed nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional analysis consisted of 517 nonmuscle 
invasive bladder cancer patients who contributed a urine or saliva specimen the 
same day as self-reporting their smoking, use of e-cigarettes, nicotine 
replacement therapy and whether they lived with a smoker. Cotinine, the primary 
metabolite of nicotine, was used as an objective biomarker of recent nicotine 
exposure.
RESULTS: The prevalence of high, low and no cotinine exposure was 13%, 54% and 
33%, respectively. Overall, 7.3% of patients (38/517) reported being a current 
cigarette smoker, while 13% (65/517) had cotinine levels consistent with active 
smoking exposure. Of these 65 patients 27 denied current smoking, resulting in a 
sensitivity of self-reported current smoking of 58%. After considering other 
sources of nicotine exposure such as e-cigarettes, cigars, nicotine replacement 
therapy and living with a smoker, the sensitivity was higher, at 82%. Nearly all 
patients with low cotinine denied any smoking-related exposure.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest either biochemical verification with cotinine 
or additional questions about other sources of nicotine are needed to accurately 
identify nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer patients who have smoking-related 
exposures. Accurate classification of active and passive smoking exposure is 
essential to allow clinicians to advise cessation and help researchers estimate 
the association between post-diagnosis smoking-related exposure and nonmuscle 
invasive bladder cancer recurrence risk.

Background: The use of high-nicotine content e-cigarettes (so-called pods, such 
as Juul) among adolescents raises concerns about early onset of nicotine 
addiction. Methods: In this analysis of adolescents surveyed from April 
2017-April 2018, we compare survey responses and urinary cotinine of pod vs. 
non-pod using past-week e-cigarette users aged 12-21. Results: More pod users 
categorized themselves as daily users compared to non-pod users (63.0% vs. 
11.0%; p = 0.001); more pod than non-pod users had used e-cigarettes within the 
past day (76.2% vs. 29.6%; p = 0.001). More pod users responded affirmatively to 
nicotine dependence questions (21.4% vs. 7.1%; p = 0.04). Urinary cotinine 
levels were compared among those responding positively and negatively to 
dependence questions: those with positive responses had significantly higher 
urinary cotinine levels than those responding negatively. Conclusions: 
Adolescents who used pod products showed more signs of nicotine dependence than 
non-pod users. Pediatricians should be vigilant in identifying dependence 
symptoms in their patients who use e-cigarettes, particularly in those using pod 
devices.

Background Little clinical research on new-generation heat-not-burn cigarettes ( 
HNBC ) in comparison with electronic vaping cigarettes ( EVC ) and traditional 
tobacco combustion cigarettes ( TC ) has been reported. We aimed to appraise the 
acute effects of single use of HNBC , EVC, and TC in healthy smokers. Methods 
and Results This was an independent, cross-over, randomized trial in 20 TC 
smokers, with allocation to different cycles of HNBC , EVC , and TC . All 
participants used all types of products, with an intercycle washout of 1 week. 
End points were oxidative stress, antioxidant reserve, platelet activation, 
flow-mediated dilation, blood pressure, and satisfaction scores. Single use of 
any product led to an adverse impact on oxidative stress, antioxidant reserve, 
platelet function, flow-mediated dilation, and blood pressure. HNBC had less 
impact than EVC and TC on soluble Nox2-derived peptide (respectively, P=0.004 
and 0.001), 8-iso-prostaglandin F2α- III ( P=0.004 and <0.001), and vitamin E ( 
P=0.018 and 0.044). HNBC and EVC were equally less impactful than TCs on 
flow-mediated dilation ( P=0.872 for HNBC versus EVC ), H2O2 ( P=0.522), H2O2 
breakdown activity ( P=0.091), soluble CD 40 ligand ( P=0.849), and soluble 
P-selectin ( P=0.821). The effect of HNBC and, to a lesser extent EVC , on blood 
pressure was less evident than that of TC , whereas HNBC appeared more 
satisfying than EVC (all P<0.05). Conclusions Acute effects of HNBC , EVC, and 
TC are different on several oxidative stress, antioxidant reserve, platelet 
function, cardiovascular, and satisfaction dimensions, with TCs showing the most 
detrimental changes in clinically relevant features. Clinical Trial Registration

INTRODUCTION/OBJECTIVE: Tobacco smoking is a well-known risk factor for 
cardiovascular and renal diseases. In recent years, alternative types of 
smoking, including vaping, have been becoming popular. The contribution of vape 
to vascular and renal injury is not known. We studied the relation between 
smoking of traditional/electronic cigarettes and arterial stiffness and 
albuminuria, which is also a vascular dysfunction marker.
METHODS: We examined 270 young volunteers without significant clinical 
cardiovascular diseases (mean age: 21.2 ± 2.3 years). Twenty-seven percent of 
the subjects in the study group were smokers; 69.9% of them smoked traditional 
cigarettes and 30.1% smoked electronic cigarettes. The urine albumin level was 
assessed by a dipstick test, and the augmentation index was determined by 
photoplethysmography. A linear correlation test and multiple regression analysis 
were applied.
RESULTS: The study groups did not differ in basic characteristics. The smokers 
demonstrated generally higher blood pressure levels and were overweight. Most of 
the smokers were male. In the groups of smokers, albuminuria was more frequent, 
especially among vapers (94 vs. 79% in tobacco smokers and 29% in nonsmokers). 
AU values (median [quartile 25; quartile 75]) were significantly higher in 
vapers (160 mg/L [150; 207.5]) vs. tobacco smokers (115 mg/L [60; 200]) and vs. 
nonsmokers (20 mg/L [10; 50]) (р < 0.05). Photoplethysmographic results showed 
relevant higher augmentation indices among tobacco smokers (-4, [-6.6; -1.9]) 
and vapers (-5.05 [-13.4; -3.3]) compared to nonsmokers (-16.2 [-23.9; -7]) (р < 
0.05). Results of multiple regression analysis demonstrate that smoking of both 
traditional and electronic cigarettes is related to an increase in the 
albuminuria level and the augmentation index.
CONCLUSIONS: Smoking of both traditional and electronic cigarettes is related to 
albuminuria and an increase in the augmentation index, which is a noninvasive 
marker for arterial stiffness.

The available literature indicates that smoking causes quantitative and 
qualitative changes in saliva. However, there is a lack of studies summarizing 
the knowledge in this area, and there are no clear guidelines on the use of 
salivary biomarkers for assessing exposure to cigarette smoke (CS). The present 
work aimed to provide a systematic review of the literature regarding the 
influence of smoking traditional and electronic cigarettes, as well as 
heat-not-burn products, on salivary homeostasis. An electronic search of the 
literature from 1982 to 2023 was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Based on the 
inclusion criteria, 65 studies were used for the final review. Smoking 
traditional as well as electronic cigarettes negatively affects salivary 
biomarkers, including the salivary flow rate, pH, antibody titer, electrolyte 
concentration, microflora composition, redox balance, and inflammation, in terms 
of both quantity and quality. However, to date, only single salivary biomarkers 
have been compared in traditional and electronic cigarette smokers. It can be 
concluded that the salivary production rate, pH, microbiome, and cytokines can 
be used to assess exposure to CS smoke. There is a lack of convincing evidence 
to compare the toxic influence of traditional and electronic cigarettes on 
salivary homeostasis. Future experiments should include long-term randomized 
clinical trials on larger populations of smokers.

Tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs), in particular, the human carcinogens 
4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) and N'-nitrosonornicotine 
(NNN), are important toxicants in tobacco and also (as contaminants) in nicotine 
products. In a clinical study comprising a period of 74 h under confinement, we 
investigated the exposure to NNK, NNN, N'-nitrosoanabasine (NAB), and 
N'-nitrosoanatabine (NAT) as well as to the minor tobacco alkaloids anabasine 
(AB) and anatabine (AT) by measuring suitable biomarkers in habitual users of 
combustible cigarettes (CCs), electronic cigarettes (ECs), heated tobacco 
products (HTPs), oral tobacco (OT), and nicotine replacement therapy products 
(NRTs). Non-users (NU) of any tobacco/nicotine products served as the (negative) 
control group. Smokers exhibited the highest levels for all biomarkers measured, 
except for AB in urine, which was found to be highest in OT users. Somewhat 
elevated levels compared to NU, EC, and NRT groups were also observed in the 
users of HTPs. In the users of tobacco-containing products (CC, HTP, and OT), 
most frequently the biomarkers significantly correlated with the dose markers 
such as daily consumption, urinary nicotine equivalents (Nequ), and plasma 
cotinine (CotP). In conclusion, except for smokers (CC) and OT users, exposure 
of users of ECs, HTPs, and NRTs to TSNAs as well as the minor tobacco alkaloids 
AB and AT is marginal and statistically not distinguishable from that of NU. 
Finally, our results for NNN in the saliva provide preliminary evidence for the 
formation of NNN from the precursor nornicotine in the presence of thiocyanate 
as a catalyst. The latter hypothesis requires experimental verification.

Liquid nicotine used in electronic cigarette devices is highly concentrated, 
unreliably packaged, and poorly regulated. We present a case report of a 
6-year-old female who developed severe toxicity and required intubation after an 
unintentional oral ingestion of approximately 703 mg (35 mg/kg) of liquid 
nicotine, with accompanying serum and urine concentrations of nicotine and its 
metabolites. Analysis of the ingested liquid suggests a nicotine concentration 
of 140.6 mg/mL in the purchased commercial product, or 234% of its labeled 
concentration. Clinicians should be aware of these products and the potential 
severity of toxicity they may incur.

Background Cardiovascular safety is an important consideration regarding the 
benefits versus risks of electronic cigarette use (EC) for public health. The 
single-use cardiovascular effects of EC have been well studied but may not 
reflect effects of ad libitum use throughout the day. We aimed to compare the 
circadian hemodynamic effects as well as 24-hour biomarkers of oxidative stress, 
and platelet aggregation and inflammation, with ad libitum cigarette smoking 
(CS) versus EC versus no tobacco product use. Methods and Results Thirty-six 
healthy dual CS and EC users participated in a crossover study in a confined 
research setting. Circadian heart rate, blood pressure and plasma nicotine 
levels, 24-hour urinary catecholamines, 8-isoprostane and 11-dehydro-thromboxane 
B2, and plasma interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 were compared in CS, EC, and no 
nicotine conditions. Over 24 hours, and during daytime, heart rate and blood 
pressure were higher in CS and EC compared with no tobacco product conditions 
(P<0.01). Heart rate on average was higher with CS versus EC. Urinary 
catecholamines, 8-isoprostane, and 11-dehydro-thromboxane B2 were not 
significantly different, but plasma IL-6 and IL-8 were higher with both CS and 
EC compared with no tobacco product (P<0.01). Conclusions CS and EC had similar 
24-hour patterns of hemodynamic effects compared with no tobacco product, with a 
higher average heart rate with CS versus EC, and similar effects on biomarkers 
of inflammation. EC may pose some cardiovascular risk, particularly to smokers 
with underlying cardiovascular disease, but may also provide a harm reduction 
opportunity for smokers willing to switch entirely to EC. Registration URL:

University, Daegu, Republic of Korea.

RATIONALE: Since tobacco contains numerous harmful substances, besides nicotine, 
which is addictive, smoking cessation products and tobacco alternatives, such as 
electronic (e-) cigarettes, nicotine chewing gums, and patches, are being widely 
used. Nicotine gums are consumed orally. The nicotine from the gum is absorbed 
at a slower rate than that from e-cigarettes, and the former remains in the 
bloodstream for a longer period. In addition, the maximum number of daily doses 
is high, and it can be purchased without a doctor's prescription in many 
countries.
PATIENT CONCERNS: A 29-year-old male patient consumed 5 2-mg nicotine gums at a 
time, twice a day, for 4 days (total amount: 70 mg). However, he visited the 
emergency unit with the chief complaint of involuntary limb movements after 
consuming an additional 15 gums 3 hour before the visit. At admission, his 
consciousness was clear, although 2 hour later, he experienced sudden loss of 
consciousness with worsening hypoxia and respiratory acidosis.
DIAGNOSIS: The patient's vital signs were stable at the time of admission, and 
blood test results showed no specific findings other than a white blood cell 
count of 14,800/µL, lactate level of 6.4 mmol/L, and prolactin level of 
119.02 ng/mL. In addition, chest radiography and head computed tomography scans 
showed no acute phase abnormalities. Two hours later, he experienced loss of 
consciousness and respiratory failure, and the results of blood tests performed 
at this time showed that his blood cotinine level was 3491 ng/mL.
INTERVENTIONS: Supportive treatment, including endotracheal intubation followed 
by mechanical ventilation, was provided.
OUTCOME: The patient's vital signs stabilized 3 days after treatment, and his 
consciousness and respiratory status had improved; therefore, mechanical 
ventilation was stopped. His condition was stable for the next 2 days, and he 
was discharged on the fifth day.
LESSONS: Acute respiratory exacerbation due to nicotine poisoning (from levels 
exceeding the lethal dose of 30-60 mg) was observed, although the gums were 
consumed over several days. Patients with nicotine poisoning may show acute 
respiratory failure and should be monitored carefully. Further studies are 
required to determine the toxic effects of nicotine replacement therapies.

BACKGROUND: There is an urgent need to understand the safety of e-cigarettes 
with adolescents. We sought to identify the presence of chemical toxicants 
associated with e-cigarette use among adolescents.
METHODS: Adolescent e-cigarette users (≥1 use within the past 30 days, ≥10 
lifetime e-cigarette use episodes) were divided into e-cigarette-only users (no 
cigarettes in the past 30 days, urine 
4-[methylnitrosamino]-1-[3-pyridyl]-1-butanol [NNAL] level <1 pg/mL of 
creatinine; n = 67), dual users (use of cigarettes in the past 30 days in 
addition to e-cigarettes, NNAL level >30 pg/mL; n = 16), and never-using 
controls (N = 20). Saliva was collected within 24 hours of the last e-cigarette 
use for analysis of cotinine and urine for analysis of NNAL and levels of 8 
volatile organic chemical compounds. Bivariate analyses compared 
e-cigarette-only users with dual users, and regression analyses compared 
e-cigarette-only users with dual users and controls on levels of toxicants.
RESULTS: The participants were 16.4 years old on average. Urine excretion of 
metabolites of benzene, ethylene oxide, acrylonitrile, acrolein, and acrylamide 
was significantly higher in dual users versus e-cigarette-only users (all P < 
.05). Excretion of metabolites of acrylonitrile, acrolein, propylene oxide, 
acrylamide, and crotonaldehyde were significantly higher in e-cigarette-only 
users compared with controls (all P < .05).
CONCLUSIONS: Although e-cigarette vapor may be less hazardous than tobacco 
smoke, our findings can be used to challenge the idea that e-cigarette vapor is 
safe, because many of the volatile organic compounds we identified are 
carcinogenic. Messaging to teenagers should include warnings about the potential 
risk from toxic exposure to carcinogenic compounds generated by these products.

Exposure assessment in children, especially young children, presents 
difficulties not found with adults. Simple silicone wristbands are passive 
samplers that have potential applicability in exposure studies of children. We 
investigated the performance of silicone wristbands as personal nicotine 
samplers in two wristbands worn by a child (n = 31) for 7 days and for 2 days 
(worn day 5 to day 7). We compared levels of nicotine in wristbands with urinary 
cotinine, a metabolite of nicotine, measured in the child's urine obtained on 
day 7. Children were recruited who were exposed to contaminants in tobacco smoke 
and/or vapor from electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS; commonly known as 
electronic cigarettes or EC) as well as children who lived in nonsmoking homes. 
Caregivers were interviewed to obtain reported measures of the child's exposure. 
Analysis was by liquid chromatography with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry 
and isotope dilution (LC-MS/MS). The nicotine detected in the wristbands worn 
for 2 days was highly correlated with urinary cotinine concentration (df = 29, 
r2 = 0.741, p < 0.001), as was nicotine in wristbands worn for 7 days (df = 28, 
r2 = 0.804, p < 0.001). The 2- and 7-day wristband nicotine amounts were also 
significantly correlated (df = 28, r2 = 0.852, p < 0.001). Silicone wristbands 
may be a useful tool for epidemiological and intervention studies of tobacco 
product exposure in children.

It is unclear how oxidative stress triggered by smoking and vaping may alter 
specific immune cell subsets. In this study, we showed that tobacco cigarette 
smoking, but not electronic-cigarette vaping, is associated with increased 
expression of major proteins in the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) 
inflammasome-interleukin (IL)-6 signalling axis in monocyte subtypes and T 
cells. TLR4 senses oxidative stress in immune cells caspase-1 is a key protein 
of inflammasome activation, and IL-6R-α is the receptor for IL-6 that drives 
proatherogenic IL-6 signalling. These findings implicate the non-nicotine, 
pro-oxidant toxicants in tobacco cigarette smoke as instigators of increased 
expression of key proteins in the TLR4-inflammasome-IL-6 axis that contribute to 
atherogenesis.

On ignore comment le stress oxydatif, déclenché par le tabagisme et le vapotage, 
peut modifier des sous-ensembles particuliers de cellules immunitaires. Dans 
cette étude, nous avons montré que le tabagisme, mais pas le vapotage à l’aide 
de cigarettes électroniques, est associé à une augmentation de l’expression des 
principales protéines de l’axe de signalisation inflammasome-interleukine (IL)-6 
du récepteur de type Toll 4 (TLR4) dans les sous-types de monocytes et les 
lymphocytes T. Le TLR4 détecte le stress oxydatif dans les cellules 
immunitaires; la caspase-1 est une protéine clé de l’activation de 
l’inflammasome, et l’IL-6R-α est le récepteur de l’IL-6 qui active la voie de 
signalisation proathérogène de l’IL-6. Ces résultats laissent entendre que les 
substances toxiques pro-oxydantes non nicotiniques de la fumée de cigarette 
provoqueraient l’augmentation de l’expression des protéines clés de l’axe 
TLR4-infilammasome-IL-6 qui contribuent à l’athérogénèse.

OBJECTIVE: Compared to the general U.S. population, smokers with comorbid 
psychiatric and/or substance use disorders have lower quit rates after 
evidence-based treatments and disproportionately high smoking-related deaths. 
Improved modalities for reducing tobacco-related harm in this subpopulation are 
needed. Because electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) can now deliver 
physiologically relevant levels of nicotine to consumers, they represent an 
additional nicotine delivery system that could be used in cessation 
interventions. While current data suggest that the use of e-cigarettes by 
smokers promotes a reduction in combustible cigarette use, smoking quit rates 
through use of e-cigarettes appears to be low. The goal of this study was to 
examine impact of e-cigarette use on combustible tobacco use as well as on the 
readiness to quit smoking and changes in nicotine dependence in a multimorbid 
population.
METHODS: We conducted a 4-week, open-label study in 43 military veteran smokers 
who had no immediate intention to stop smoking and were currently receiving 
psychiatric services from the Department of Veterans Affairs health care system. 
Participants were provided with a study e-cigarette they could use ad libitum 
along with other tobacco products and were encouraged to attend weekly 
laboratory visits and a one-month follow-up visit. Main outcome measures were 
number of cigarettes smoked per day (CPD), the frequency of e-cigarette use, the 
amount of money spent on combustible cigarettes (U.S. dollars/week), alveolar 
carbon monoxide (CO) levels, and urine cotinine levels.
RESULTS: Mean e-cigarette use was 5.7 days per week and only 9% of participants 
used the e-cigarette for fewer than 4 days per week. Significant reductions in 
breath CO (9.3 ppm to 7.3 ppm, p < .02) and CPD (from 16.6 to 5.7, p < .001) 
were observed across study weeks, and no serious adverse events were reported. 
Three participants (10% of completers) reported smoking cessation that was 
corroborated biochemically. At one-month follow-up, motivation to quit smoking 
remained significantly higher and the level of nicotine dependence was 
significantly lower than at baseline.
CONCLUSIONS: E-cigarettes are acceptable to smokers with psychiatric 
comorbidities, as indicated by sustained and frequent e-cigarette use by 90% of 
participants, and may promote reduction and/or cessation of combustible 
cigarette use. E-cigarettes appear to be a viable harm reduction modality in 
smokers with psychiatric comorbidities.

Background Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) have been proposed as a 
potential harm reduction tool for combustible cigarette smokers. The majority of 
adult e-cigarette users continue to smoke combustible cigarettes and are 
considered dual users. The vascular impact of e-cigarettes remains incompletely 
defined. Methods and Results We examined the association of e-cigarette use with 
measures of vascular function and tonometry, preclinical measures of 
cardiovascular injury. As part of the CITU (Cardiovascular Injury due to Tobacco 
Use) study, we performed noninvasive vascular function testing in individuals 
without known cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular disease risk factors who 
were nonsmokers (n=94), users of combustible cigarettes (n=285), users of 
e-cigarettes (n=36), or dual users (n=52). In unadjusted analyses, measures of 
arterial stiffness including carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, augmentation 
index, carotid-radial pulse wave velocity, and central blood pressures differed 
across the use groups. In multivariable models adjusted for age, sex, race, and 
study site, combustible cigarette smokers had higher augmentation index compared 
with nonusers (129.8±1.5 versus 118.8±2.7, P=0.003). The augmentation index was 
similar between combustible cigarette smokers compared with sole e-cigarette 
users (129.8±1.5 versus 126.2±5.9, P=1.0) and dual users (129.8±1.5 versus 
134.9±4.0, P=1.0). Endothelial cells from combustible cigarette smokers and sole 
e-cigarette users produced less nitric oxide in response to A23187 stimulation 
compared with nonsmokers, suggestive of impaired endothelial nitric oxide 
synthase signaling. Conclusions Our findings suggest that e-cigarette use is not 
associated with a more favorable vascular profile. Future longitudinal studies 
are needed to evaluate the long-term risks of sustained e-cigarette use.

INTRODUCTION: IQOS was authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
as a modified-risk tobacco product. We conducted a pharmacokinetic study 
evaluating the nicotine delivery and subjective effects of IQOS use among 
current menthol cigarette smokers to better understand if IQOS is an acceptable 
cigarette alternative in light of the proposed menthol cigarette ban.
AIMS AND METHODS: Participants were adult smokers of >4 menthol cigarettes per 
day. After 14-hour nicotine abstinence, participants were provided an IQOS 
device and menthol heatstick to puff every 20 seconds for a total of 14 puffs. 
Blood samples were collected at baseline and during active use to calculate 
nicotine boost from baseline to peak concentration. Nicotine withdrawal symptoms 
were collected before and after IQOS use. In addition, a modified Product 
Evaluation Scale for IQOS was collected after use.
RESULTS: Participants (n = 8) were a mean age of 43.9 years, 63% were female, 
88% identified as White, and they smoked a mean of 17.1 menthol cigarettes per 
day. After IQOS use, the mean nicotine boost obtained was 15.96 ng/mL (SD = 
6.91) (range 9.31 to 30.55 ng/mL). Most (75%) participants reported enjoying use 
of the product "a lot" or greater and more than half (62.5%) reported reduced 
cigarette cravings. Most participants reported no side effects after use; 
however, two experienced dry mouth, three experienced dizziness, one experienced 
throat irritation, and one experienced headache.
CONCLUSION: We found that directed use (14 puffs) of menthol IQOS delivered a 
mean nicotine boost of 15.96 ng/mL which reduced craving for a cigarette. The 
majority of participants enjoyed use of IQOS and reported mild side effects.
IMPLICATIONS: Menthol IQOS delivered a sufficient dose of nicotine perceived as 
satisfying by menthol cigarette smokers and it reduced craving with mild side 
effects. Menthol IQOS has potential to serve as a less harmful alternative for 
menthol cigarette smokers. The availability of modified risk products like IQOS 
should be considered by FDA's Comprehensive Plan for Tobacco and Nicotine 
Regulation.

Background Previous studies showed that nicotinized electronic cigarettes 
(hereafter, e-cigarettes) elicit systemic oxidative stress and inflammation. 
However, the effect of the aerosol alone on endothelial function is not fully 
understood. Purpose To quantify surrogate markers of endothelial function in 
nonsmokers after inhalation of aerosol from nicotine-free e-cigarettes. 
Materials and Methods In this prospective study (from May to September 2018), 
nonsmokers underwent 3.0-T MRI before and after inhaling nicotine-free 
e-cigarette aerosol. Peripheral vascular reactivity to cuff-induced ischemia was 
quantified by temporally resolving blood flow velocity and oxygenation (SvO2) in 
superficial femoral artery and vein, respectively, along with artery luminal 
flow-mediated dilation. Precuff occlusion, resistivity index, baseline blood 
flow velocity, and SvO2 were evaluated. During reactive hyperemia, blood flow 
velocity yielded peak velocity, time to peak, and acceleration rate (hyperemic 
index); SvO2 yielded washout time of oxygen-depleted blood, rate of 
resaturation, and maximum SvO2 increase (overshoot). Cerebrovascular reactivity 
was assessed in the superior sagittal sinus, evaluating the breath-hold index. 
Central arterial stiffness was measured via aortic pulse wave velocity. 
Differences before versus after e-cigarette vaping were tested with Hotelling T2 
test. Results Thirty-one healthy never-smokers (mean age, 24.3 years ± 4.3; 14 
women) were evaluated. After e-cigarette vaping, resistivity index was higher 
(0.03 of 1.30 [2.3%]; P < .05), luminal flow-mediated dilation severely blunted 
(-3.2% of 9.4% [-34%]; P < .001), along with reduced peak velocity (-9.9 of 56.6 
cm/sec [-17.5%]; P < .001), hyperemic index (-3.9 of 15.1 cm/sec2 [-25.8%]; P < 
.001), and delayed time to peak (2.1 of 7.1 sec [29.6%]; P = .005); baseline 
SvO2 was lower (-13 of 65 %HbO2 [-20%]; P < .001) and overshoot higher (10 of 19 
%HbO2 [52.6%]; P < .001); and aortic pulse wave velocity marginally increased 
(0.19 of 6.05 m/sec [3%]; P = .05). Remaining parameters did not change after 
aerosol inhalation. Conclusion Inhaling nicotine-free electronic cigarette 
aerosol transiently impacted endothelial function in healthy nonsmokers. Further 
studies are needed to address the potentially adverse long-term effects on 
vascular health. © RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this

The aim of the study was to estimate the thiocyanate levels in saliva of 
cigarette smokers in comparison to e-cigarette smokers and nonsmokers. To 
improve our understanding of the influence of smoking on the oral level of 
thiocyanate, we conducted an assessment of human saliva, in 24 individuals 
(eight tobacco smokers, eight e-cigarette smokers, and eight nonsmokers). 
High-Performance Liquid Chromatography with ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV) 
using a unique phosphatidylcholine column was applied in this assay. Thiocyanate 
ion was detected directly by its absorbance at 210 nm. The method presents a new 
application of the IAM (Immobilized Artificial Membrane) column for 
quantification of inorganic anions. The whole process meets the criteria of 
green chemistry because it was carried out without the use of organic solvents. 
For compensating matrix effects, an eight-point standard addition protocol was 
used to quantify the thiocyanate level in saliva samples. The calibration graphs 
were linear in the range of 5-100 mg L-1 with a correlation coefficient higher 
than 0.99. The thiocyanate concentrations in the saliva of tobacco smokers, 
e-cigarette smokers, and nonsmokers were found in the range of 121.25-187.54 mg 
L-1, 121.24-244.11 mg L-1, 33.03-79.49 mg L-1, respectively. The present study 
indicates an obvious statistically significant elevation in salivary thiocyanate 
level in tobacco smokers in comparison to nonsmokers. The 
phosphatidylcholine-based stationary phase proved to be suitable for the 
detection and quantification of the thiocyanate ion. The salivary thiocyanate 
levels in e-cigarette smokers were not significantly different in comparison to 
tobacco smokers but higher if compared to nonsmokers. The criterion for 
statistical significance was p < 0.05.

Concern has been raised about the presence of toxicants in electronic cigarette 
(EC) aerosol, particularly carbonyl compounds (e.g., acrolein) that can be 
produced by heating glycerol and glycols used in e-liquids. We investigated 
exposure to carbon monoxide (CO), nicotine (by measuring cotinine in urine), and 
to acrolein (by measuring its primary metabolite, S-(3-hydroxypropyl)mercapturic 
acid (3-HPMA) in urine) before and after 4 weeks of EC (green smoke, a 
"cig-a-like" EC, labeled 2.4% nicotine by volume) use, in 40 smokers. 
Thirty-three participants were using EC at 4 weeks after quitting, 16 (48%) were 
abstinent (CO-validated) from smoking during the previous week (EC only users), 
and 17 (52%) were "dual users." A significant reduction in CO was observed in 
EC-only users [-12 ppm, 95% confidence interval (CI), -16 to -7, 80% decrease) 
and dual users (-12 ppm, 95%CI, -19 to -6, 52% decrease). Cotinine levels also 
declined, but to a lesser extent (EC-only users: -184 ng/mg creatinine; 95% CI, 
-733 to -365, 17% decrease; and dual users: -976 ng/mg creatinine; 95%CI, -1,682 
to -270, 44% decrease). Mean 3-HPMA levels had decreased at 4 weeks by 1,280 
ng/mg creatinine (95%CI, -1,699 to -861, 79% decrease) in EC-only users and by 
1,474 ng/mg creatinine (95%CI, -2,101 to -847, 60% decrease) in dual users. In 
dual users, EC use significantly reduced exposure to CO and acrolein because of 
a reduction in smoke intake. EC may reduce harm even in smokers who continue to 
smoke, but long-term follow-up studies are needed to confirm this.

INTRODUCTION: Use of alternative nicotine delivery systems, such as electronic 
cigarettes and hookahs, has increased dramatically in the USA, but limited 
research has been conducted on the secondhand effects of these products, 
especially in children. The objective of this study is to assess the 
cardiopulmonary effects of e-cigarette and hookah use in vaping and smoking 
adults, and in non-smoking/non-vaping adults and children exposed to secondhand 
particles and gases.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study uses a pre/post design, with four groups: two 
control groups (non-smoking/non-vaping and cigarette smoking) and two test 
groups (hookah smoking and e-cigarette vaping). Participants will be recruited 
by household, so that each home includes one smoking or vaping adult and one 
non-smoking/non-vaping adult and/or child (5-18 years). Non-smoking/non-vaping 
homes include an adult and child who do not smoke or vape and do not live with 
individuals who do. Air quality measures will be completed during a household 
smoking or vaping session (ambient air for non-smoking/non-vaping group), while 
cardiopulmonary measures and biological samples will be taken directly before 
and after the smoking/vaping session, and again 24 hours later, for all 
participants. Air quality measures include carbon monoxide, black carbon, 
particulate matter, trace elements, nicotine and carbonyls; cardiopulmonary 
measures include heart rate variability, blood pressure, pulmonary function and 
exhaled carbon monoxide; biological samples will assess cotinine, inflammatory 
cytokines and biomarkers in urine, saliva and nasal mucosa.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study was approved by the Institutional Review 
Board at New York University School of Medicine (s16-02226 and s17-01143). 
Special attention was given to the inclusion of children, who are likely 
significantly impacted by the use of these products at home, and thus should be 
included in research. Results of the study will be distributed at conferences, 
in peer-reviewed journals and to relevant public health authorities for use in 
developing policy.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of an acute (1 week) and chronic (3 weeks) 
exposure to E-cigarette (E-cig) emissions on mucociliary clearance (MCC) in 
murine lungs.
METHODS: C57BL/6 male mice (age 10.5 ± 2.4 weeks) were exposed for 20 min/day to 
E-cigarette aerosol generated by a Joyetech 510-T® E-cig containing either 0% 
nicotine (N)/propylene glycol (PG) for 1 week (n = 6), or 3 weeks (n = 9), or 
2.4% N/PG for one week (n = 6), or 3 weeks (n = 9), followed by measurement of 
MCC. Control mice (n = 15) were not exposed to PG alone, or N/PG. MCC was 
assessed by gamma camera following aspiration of 99mtechnetium aerosol and was 
expressed as the amount of radioactivity removed from both lungs over 6 hours 
(MCC6hrs). Venous blood was assayed for cotinine levels in control mice and in 
mice exposed for 3-weeks to PG alone and N/PG.
RESULTS: MCC6hrs in control mice and in mice acutely exposed to PG alone and 
N/PG was similar, averaging (±1 standard deviation) 8.6 ± 5.2%, 7.5 ± 2.8% and 
11.2 ± 5.9%, respectively. In contrast, chronic exposure to PG alone stimulated 
MCC6hrs (17.2 ± 8.0)% and this stimulation was significantly blunted following 
chronic exposure to N/PG (8.7 ± 4.6)% (p < .05). Serum cotinine levels were 
<0.5 ng/ml in control mice and in mice exposed to PG alone, whereas, N/PG 
exposed mice averaged 14.6 ± 12.0 ng/ml.
CONCLUSIONS: In this murine model, a chronic, daily, 20 min-exposure to N/PG, 
but not an acute exposure, slowed MCC, compared to exposure to PG alone and led 
to systemic absorption of nicotine.

Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are devices intended to substitute 
conventional cigarettes, with the aim of being less harmful. In a previous 
report, we showed that intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of e-cigarette liquid 
(E-liquid), with or without nicotine, induced toxicity in the testes of Wistar 
rats by disrupting oxidative balance and steroidogenesis. In the present work, 
we further evaluated the impact of e-liquid with or without nicotine on the 
epididymis of rats using the same procedure. Results showed that e-liquid 
treatments led to alteration of semen parameters, with a significant drop of at 
least 50% in sperm vitality, a significant increase of morphologically abnormal 
spermatozoa and an imbalance of redox status in comparison to the control group. 
A significant raise of 1.4 fold, compared to the untreated rats, in 
myeloperoxidase (MPO) granules after both treatments was recorded, suggesting an 
inflammatory state. Histopathological examination confirmed a marked reduction 
in sperm count in the cauda epididymis. Data of this study suggest that the 
pro-oxidant properties of e-liquid with or without nicotine, in addition to 
testicular defects, could lead to an inflammatory state in the epididymis, 
causing alterations in the semen parameters. These data provide additional 
information on the impact of e-liquid on the reproductive system.

INTRODUCTION: The availability of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) has 
profoundly changed the tobacco product landscape. In the United States, almost 6 
million adults use both combustible and e-cigarettes (ie, dual users). The goal 
of this study was to understand how smokers and dual users differ in terms of 
demographics, cigarette dependence, and exposure to carcinogens.
METHODS: An observational cohort (smokers, n = 166, ≥5 cigarettes/day for 6 
months and no e-cigarette use in 3 months; dual users, n = 256, smoked daily for 
3 months and used e-cigarettes at least once/week for the past 3 months) 
completed baseline assessments of demographics, tobacco use, and dependence. 
They also provided breath samples for carbon monoxide (CO) assay and urine 
samples for cotinine, 3-hydroxycotinine, and 
4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL) assays.
RESULTS: Compared to smokers, dual users (mean e-cigarette use = 5.5 days/week 
[SD = 1.9]) were significantly younger and more likely to be white, have more 
education, report a history of psychiatric co-morbidity, and smoke fewer 
cigarettes per day. There were no differences in CO, cotinine, or 
3-hydroxycotinine levels; however, dual users had significantly lower levels of 
NNAL than did smokers. Most smokers and dual users had no plans to quit smoking 
within the next year; 91% of dual users planned to continue using e-cigarettes 
for at least the next year.
CONCLUSIONS: In this community sample, dual users are supplementing their 
smoking with e-cigarette use. Dual users, versus smokers, smoked fewer 
cigarettes per day and delayed their first cigarette of the day, but did not 
differ in quitting intentions.
IMPLICATIONS: This comparison of a community sample of established dual users 
and exclusive smokers addresses key questions of dependence and health risks of 
dual use in real-world settings. Dual users were more likely to be white, 
younger, have more than a high school education and have a psychiatric history. 
Dual users also smoked significantly fewer cigarettes and had lower levels of 
NNAL (a carcinogen), but they did not differ from exclusive smokers in CO or 
cotinine levels, suggesting that they supplemented their nicotine intake via 
e-cigarettes.

It is well established that tobacco smoking is associated with vascular 
endothelial dysfunction in a causative and dose dependent manner primarily 
related to the tobacco smoke (TS) content of reactive oxygen species (ROS), 
nicotine, and oxidative stress (OS) -driven inflammation. Preclinical studies 
have also shown that nicotine (the principal e-liquid's ingredient used in 
e-cigarettes (e-Cigs) can also cause OS, exacerbation of cerebral ischemia and 
secondary brain injury. Likewise, chronic e-Cig vaping could be prodromal to 
vascular endothelial dysfunctions. Herein, we provide direct evidence that 
similarly to TS, e-Cig promotes mitochondrial depolarization in primary brain 
vascular endothelial cells as well as the vascular endothelial cell line bEnd3. 
In addition, both TS and e-Cig exposure upregulated the transmembrane iron 
exporter Slc40a1 (crucial to maintain cellular iron and redox homeostasis) and 
that of porphyrin importer Abcb6 (linked to accelerated atherosclerosis). We 
then investigated in vivo whether gender plays a role in how chronic TS affect 
vascular endothelial functions. Our results clearly show chronic TS exposure 
differentially impacts the expression levels of Phase-II enzymes as well as the 
iron transporters previously investigated in vitro. Although the physiological 
implications of the gender-specific differential responses to TS are not fully 
clear, they do demonstrate that gender is a risk factor that needs to be 
investigated when assessing the potential impact of chronic smoking and perhaps 
e-Cig vaping.

CONTEXT: Insulin resistance is a determinant of diabetes. With the increasing 
popularity of electronic smoking, the number of dual smokers (smoking both 
cigarettes and electronic cigarettes [e-cigarettes]) is increasing. However, few 
studies have assessed the association between insulin resistance and smoking 
behavior, including dual smoking.
OBJECTIVE: This work aims to investigate the association between smoking 
behaviors and insulin resistance.
METHODS: This prospective, cross-sectional study took place among the general 
community. A total of 11 653 participants (4721 male and 6932 female) aged 19 
years or older from the 2016 to 2018 Korea National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey were divided based on their smoking behaviors: dual smokers 
(both cigarettes and e-cigarettes), single smokers (cigarette smokers), previous 
smokers, and nonsmokers. Insulin resistance was determined based on the 
triglyceride-glucose index. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed 
to investigate the association between smoking behavior and insulin resistance.
RESULTS: Among the participants, 205 males (3.9%) and 40 females (0.5%) were 
dual smokers, and 1581 males (29.9%) and 350 females (4.5%) were single smokers. 
Male and female smokers (dual and single) both had higher odds of being in a 
group with higher insulin resistance than nonsmokers (male, dual: OR = 2.19; 95% 
CI, 1.39-3.44; single: OR = 1.78; 95% CI, 1.43-2.22; female, dual: OR = 2.32; 
95% CI, 1.01-5.34; single: OR = 1.76; 95% CI, 1.28-2.42).
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that single and dual smoking both may increase 
the risk of insulin resistance in the general population. Education on the 
adverse effects of smoking behaviors may be an important strategy to improve the 
health of the population.

Biomarkers of exposure (BoE) can help evaluate exposure to combustion-related, 
tobacco-specific toxicants after smokers switch from cigarettes to potentially 
less-harmful products like electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS). This 
paper reports data for one (Vuse Solo Original) of three products evaluated in a 
randomized, controlled, confinement study of BoE in smokers switched to ENDS. 
Subjects smoked their usual brand cigarette ad libitum for two days, then were 
randomized to one of three ENDS for a 7-day ad libitum use period, or to smoking 
abstinence. Thirteen BoE were assessed at baseline and Day 5, and percent change 
in mean values for each BoE was calculated. Biomarkers of potential harm (BoPH) 
linked to oxidative stress, platelet activation, and inflammation were also 
assessed. Levels decreased among subjects randomized to Vuse Solo versus 
Abstinence, respectively, for the following BoE: 42-96% versus 52-97% 
(non-nicotine constituents); 51% versus 55% (blood carboxyhemoglobin); and 29% 
versus 96% (nicotine exposure). Significant decreases were observed in three 
BoPH: leukotriene E4, 11-dehydro-thromboxane B2, and 2,3-dinor thromboxane B2 on 
Day 7 in the Vuse Solo and Abstinence groups. These findings show that ENDS use 
results in substantially reduced exposure to toxicants compared to smoking, 
which may lead to reduced biological effects.

BACKGROUND: While tobacco smoke contains thousands of chemicals, some of which 
are carcinogenic to humans, the content of electronic cigarette smoke is less 
known. This work aimed to assess and compare the exposure associated with 
different smoking habits by profiling urinary mercapturic acids as biomarkers of 
toxic compounds.
METHODS: In this pilot study, sixty-seven healthy adults with different smoking 
habits were investigated: 38 non-smokers (NS), 7 electronic cigarette users 
(ECU), and 22 traditional tobacco smokers (TTS). Seventeen urinary mercapturic 
acids, metabolites of 1,3-butadiene (DHBMA, MHBMA), 4-chloronitrobenze (NANPC), 
acrolein (3-HPMA), acrylamide (AAMA, GAMA), acrylonitrile (CEMA), benzene 
(SPMA), crotonaldehyde (CMEMA, HMPMA), ethylating agents (EMA), methylating 
agents (MMA), ethylene oxide (HEMA), N,N-dimethylformamide (AMCC), propylene 
oxide (2-HPMA), styrene (PHEMA), and toluene (SBMA), were quantified, along with 
urinary nicotine and cotinine.
RESULTS: Median urinary cotinine was 0.4, 1530 and 1772 μg/L in NS, ECU and TTS, 
respectively. Most mercapturic acids were 2-165 fold-higher in TTS compared to 
NS, with CEMA, MHBMA, 3-HPMA and SPMA showing the most relevant increases. 
Furthermore, some mercapturic acids were higher in ECU than NS; CEMA and 3-HPMA, 
in particular, showed significant increases and were 1.8 and 4.9 fold-higher, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that tobacco smoking is a major source of 
carcinogenic chemicals such as benzene and 1,3-butadiene; electronic cigarette 
use is a minor source, mostly associated with exposure to chemicals with less 
carcinogenic potential such as acrylonitrile and acrolein.

A 21-Year-Old Woman with Sickle Cell Disease and Vaso-Occlusive Pain Associated 
with Using an Electronic Nicotine Dispensing System (E-Cigarette or Vape) - a 
Case Report.

BACKGROUND Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder that leads to 
multisystem complications. The heterogeneous course of sickle cell disease is 
due to both genetic modifiers and environmental factors. Cigarette smoking is a 
strong risk factor for sickle cell complications and even secondhand exposure to 
tobacco smoke can be detrimental for individuals with sickle cell disease. 
However, no prior reports have associated e-cigarettes and sickle cell 
vaso-occlusive pain. CASE REPORT A 21 year old woman presented with sickle cell 
disease SS complicated by frequent pain, multiple acute chest syndrome episodes, 
sickle cell nephropathy, and avascular necrosis of the left hip, plus mild 
intermittent asthma. She developed pain in the ribs and back after her first use 
of e-cigarettes. After 4 days of home pain management, she came to the Emergency 
Department. She was mildly hypoxic and received supplemental oxygen. Chest 
radiograph did not show airspace consolidation, and the sites of pain were 
consistent with her prior pain episodes, so the diagnosis was sickle cell 
vaso-occlusive pain. Her hemoglobin was more than 2 g/dL below baseline and she 
received a red blood cell transfusion on hospital day 2. Overall, this was among 
her more severe pain episodes. CONCLUSIONS The rising popularity of 
e-cigarettes, also known as vapes or Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems 
(ENDS), is partly due to the misconception that they are safer than traditional 
cigarettes. Although firm conclusions will depend on studies designed to provide 
rigorous evidence, this case suggests that the acute adverse effects of ENDS 
might trigger complications of sickle cell disease, especially with asthma as a 
comorbidity.

Dried blood spots (DBS) represent a sample matrix collected under 
minimal-invasive, straightforward and robust conditions. DBS specimens have been 
shown to provide appropriate test material for different analytical disciplines, 
e.g., preclinical drug development, therapeutic drug monitoring, forensic 
toxicology and diagnostic analysis of metabolic disorders in newborns. However, 
the sample preparation has occasionally been reported as laborious and time 
consuming. In order to minimize the manual workload and to substantiate the 
suitability of DBS for high sample-throughput, the automation of sample 
preparation processes is of paramount interest. In the current study, the 
development and validation of a fully automated DBS extraction method coupled to 
online solid-phase extraction using the example of nicotine, its major 
metabolites nornicotine, cotinine and trans-3'-hydroxycotinine and the tobacco 
alkaloids anabasine and anatabine is presented, based on the rationale that the 
use of nicotine-containing products for performance-enhancing purposes has been 
monitored by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for several years. 
Automation-derived DBS sample extracts were directed online to liquid 
chromatography high resolution/high mass accuracy tandem mass spectrometry, and 
target analytes were determined with support of four deuterated internal 
standards. Validation of the method yielded precise (CV <7.5% for intraday and 
<12.3% for interday measurements) and linear (r(2)>0.998) results. The limit of 
detection was established at 5 ng mL(-1) for all studied compounds, the 
extraction recovery ranged from 25 to 44%, and no matrix effects were observed. 
To exemplify the applicability of the DBS online-SPE LC-MS/MS approach for 
sports drug testing purposes, the method was applied to authentic DBS samples 
obtained from smokers, snus users, and e-cigarette users. Statistical evaluation 
of the obtained results indicated differences in metabolic behavior depending on 
the route of administration (inhalative versus buccal absorption) in terms of 
the ratio of nicotine and nornicotine.

CDC, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), state and local health departments, 
and public health and clinical partners are investigating a multistate outbreak 
of lung injury associated with the use of electronic cigarette (e-cigarette), or 
vaping, products. In late August, CDC released recommendations for health care 
providers regarding e-cigarette, or vaping, product use associated lung injury 
(EVALI) based on limited data from the first reported cases (1,2). This report 
summarizes national surveillance data describing clinical features of more 
recently reported cases and interim recommendations based on these data for U.S. 
health care providers caring for patients with suspected or known EVALI. It 
provides interim guidance for 1) initial clinical evaluation; 2) suggested 
criteria for hospital admission and treatment; 3) patient follow-up; 4) special 
considerations for groups at high risk; and 5) clinical and public health 
recommendations. Health care providers evaluating patients suspected to have 
EVALI should ask about the use of e-cigarette, or vaping, products in a 
nonjudgmental and thorough manner. Patients suspected to have EVALI should have 
a chest radiograph (CXR), and hospital admission is recommended for patients who 
have decreased blood oxygen (O2) saturation (<95%) on room air or who are in 
respiratory distress. Health care providers should consider empiric use of a 
combination of antibiotics, antivirals, or steroids based upon clinical context. 
Evidence-based tobacco product cessation strategies, including behavioral 
counseling, are recommended to help patients discontinue use of e-cigarette, or 
vaping, products. To reduce the risk of recurrence, patients who have been 
treated for EVALI should not use e-cigarette, or vaping, products. CDC 
recommends that persons should not use e-cigarette, or vaping, products that 
contain tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). At present, CDC recommends persons consider 
refraining from using e-cigarette, or vaping, products that contain nicotine. 
Irrespective of the ongoing investigation, e-cigarette, or vaping, products 
should never be used by youths, young adults, or women who are pregnant. Persons 
who do not currently use tobacco products should not start using e-cigarette, or 
vaping, products.

RATIONALE: Over 2700 e-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated lung injury 
(EVALI) cases were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) during August 2019-February 2020. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid 
samples from 51 EVALI and 99 non-EVALI cases were analyzed for toxicants 
including petroleum distillates. We describe a novel method to measure petroleum 
distillates in BAL fluid using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS).
METHODS: n-Hexane, n-heptane, n-octane, methylcyclopentane, and cyclohexane were 
measured in BAL fluid specimens by headspace solid-phase microextraction/GC/MS. 
We created and characterized BAL fluid pools from non-EVALI individuals to 
determine assay accuracy, precision, linearity, limits of detection (LODs), and 
analytical specificity. All measurements were conducted in accordance with the 
rigorous method validation procedures of CDC's Division of Laboratory Sciences.
RESULTS: Matrix validation experiments showed that calibration curves in BAL 
fluid and saline had similar slopes, with differences less than 5%. Assay 
precision ranged from 1.98% to 18%. In addition, the LODs for the five analytes 
ranged from 0.05 to 0.10 μg/L, and their linearity was confirmed with R2 values 
>0.99. The analysis of selected petroleum distillates in BAL fluid analysis was 
shown to be comparable with their analysis in blood in which the 95th 
percentiles are below detection.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed and validated a method to quantify petroleum 
distillates in BAL fluid specimens using GC/MS. The assay provided precise and 
accurate analyses of EVALI and non-EVALI BAL fluid specimens in support of CDC's 
EVALI response. This method is applicable to the determination of a broad range 
of volatile organic compounds in BAL fluid specimens.

Currently, the marketing of electronic cigarettes as a safe alternative to 
smoking has increased, which is associated with greater use of these devices, 
especially among young people and smokers interested in quitting tobacco 
cigarettes. Given the growing use of this type of product, there is a need to 
determine the consequences of electronic cigarettes on human health, especially 
since many of the compounds contained in the aerosol and liquid of these devices 
have a high potential to be carcinogenic and genotoxic. Additionally, many of 
these compounds' aerosol concentrations exceed the safe limits. We have 
evaluated the levels of genotoxicity and changes in DNA methylation patterns 
associated with vaping. We analyzed a total of 90 peripheral blood samples from 
a population of vapers (n = 32), smokers (n = 18), and controls (n = 32), in 
which the frequencies of genotoxicity were determined by the 
cytokinesis-blocking micronuclei (CBMN) assay and the patterns of methylation of 
the repetitive elements of LINE-1 through the Quantitative Methylation Specific 
PCR (qMSP) assay. Here we show an increase in genotoxicity levels associated 
with vaping habits. Additionally, the group of vapers showed changes at the 
epigenetic level specifically associated with the loss of methylation of the 
LINE-1 elements. These changes in LINE-1 methylation patterns were reflected in 
its representative RNA expression detected in vapers.

Some persons who smoke have substituted e-cigarettes for tobacco cigarettes, 
either completely or partially. What effect does this have on cardiovascular 
functioning? We conducted a living systematic review on human clinical studies 
measuring the cardiovascular effects of e-cigarette substitution for smoking. 
The Scopus, PubMed, and CENTRAL Cochrane Library databases were searched on 
January 31 and April 29, 2021. Three secondary searches and a grey literature 
search were conducted. Included study designs were randomized controlled trials, 
quasi-experimental clinical trials, and cohort studies. Risk of bias and study 
quality were evaluated with the JBI Critical Appraisal tools and the Oxford 
Catalogue of Bias. The systematic review covered 25 studies comprising 1810 
participants who smoked. Twenty studies were rated at high risk of bias, and 
five as some concerns. A tabular synthesis by direction of effect was conducted 
due to heterogeneity in the data. Nearly two-thirds of the test analyses 
indicated that e-cigarette use had no significance difference compared with 
tobacco cigarettes on heart rate, blood pressure, and in other cardiovascular 
tests. In two studies, participants with hypertension experienced a clinically 
relevant reduction in systolic blood pressure after 1 year of e-cigarette use. 
E-cigarette substitution incurs no additional cardiovascular risks, and some 
possible benefits may be obtained, but the evidence is of low to very low 
certainty. An update search on May 30, 2022 retrieved five studies that did not 
alter our conclusion.Registration PROSPERO #CRD42021239094.

JUUL is a popular e-cigarette brand that manufactures e-liquids in a variety of 
flavors, such as mango and mint. Despite their popularity, the pulmonary effects 
of flavored JUUL e-liquids that are aerosolized and subsequently inhaled are not 
known. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate if acute exposure to 
JUUL e-cigarette aerosols in three popular flavors elicits an immunomodulatory 
or oxidative stress response in mice. We first developed a preclinical model 
that mimics human use patterns of e-cigarettes using 1 puff/min or 4 puffs/min 
exposure regimes. Based on cotinine levels, these exposures were representative 
of light/occasional and moderate JUUL users. We then exposed C57BL/6 mice to 
JUUL e-cigarette aerosols in mango, mint, and Virginia tobacco flavors 
containing 5% nicotine for 3 days, and assessed the inflammatory and oxidative 
stress response in the lungs and blood. In response to the 1 puff/min regime 
(light/occasional user), there were minimal changes in BAL cell composition or 
lung mRNA expression. However, at 4 puffs/min (moderate user), mint-flavored 
JUUL significantly increased lung neutrophils, while mango-flavored JUUL 
significantly increased Tnfα and Il13 mRNA in the lungs. Both the 1- and 
4 puffs/min regimes significantly increased oxidative stress markers in the 
blood, indicating systemic effects. Thus, JUUL products are not inert; even 
short-term inhalation of flavored JUUL e-cigarette aerosols differentially 
causes immune modulation and oxidative stress responses.

INTRODUCTION: Electronic cigarettes (ECIGs) heat a nicotine-containing solution; 
the resulting aerosol is inhaled by the user. Nicotine delivery may be affected 
by users' puffing behavior (puff topography), and little is known about the puff 
topography of ECIG users. Puff topography can be measured using mouthpiece-based 
computerized systems. However, the extent to which a mouthpiece influences 
nicotine delivery and subjective effects in ECIG users is unknown.
METHODS: Plasma nicotine concentration, heart rate, and subjective effects were 
measured in 13 experienced ECIG users who used their preferred ECIG and liquid 
(≥ 12 mg/ml nicotine) during 2 sessions (with or without a mouthpiece). In both 
sessions, participants completed an ECIG use session in which they were 
instructed to take 10 puffs with 30-second inter-puff intervals. Puff topography 
was recorded in the mouthpiece condition.
RESULTS: Almost all measures of the effects of ECIG use were independent of 
topography measurement. Collapsed across session, mean plasma nicotine 
concentration increased by 16.8 ng/ml, and mean heart rate increased by 8.5 bpm 
(ps < .05). Withdrawal symptoms decreased significantly after ECIG use. 
Participants reported that the mouthpiece affected awareness and made ECIG use 
more difficult. Relative to previously reported data for tobacco cigarette 
smokers using similar topography measurement equipment, ECIG-using participants 
took larger and longer puffs with lower flow rates.
CONCLUSIONS: In experienced ECIG users, measuring ECIG topography did not 
influence ECIG-associated nicotine delivery or most measures of withdrawal 
suppression. Topography measurement systems will need to account for the low 
flow rates observed for ECIG users.

INTRODUCTION: Electronic cigarettes' (e-cigarettes) viability as a public health 
strategy to end smoking will likely be determined by their ability to mimic the 
pharmacokinetic profile of a cigarette while also exposing users to 
significantly lower levels of harmful/potentially harmful constituents (HPHCs). 
The present study examined the nicotine delivery profile of third- (G3) versus 
second-generation (G2) e-cigarette devices and their users' exposure to nicotine 
and select HPHCs compared with cigarette smokers.
METHODS: 30 participants (10 smokers, 9 G2 and 11 G3 users) completed baseline 
questionnaires and provided exhaled carbon monoxide (eCO), saliva and urine 
samples. Following a 12-hour nicotine abstinence, G2 and G3 users completed a 
2-hour vaping session (ie, 5 min, 10-puff bout followed by ad libitum puffing 
for 115 min). Blood samples, subjective effects, device characteristics and 
e-liquid consumption were assessed.
RESULTS: Smokers, G2 and G3 users had similar baseline levels of cotinine, but 
smokers had 4 and 7 times higher levels of eCO (p<0.0001) and total 
4-(Methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (i.e., NNAL, p<0.01), 
respectively, than G2 or G3 users. Compared with G2s, G3 devices delivered 
significantly higher power to the atomiser, but G3 users vaped e-cigarette 
liquids with significantly lower nicotine concentrations. During the vaping 
session, G3 users achieved significantly higher plasma nicotine concentrations 
than G2 users following the first 10 puffs (17.5 vs 7.3 ng/mL, respectively) and 
at 25 and 40 min of ad libitum use. G3 users consumed significantly more 
e-liquid than G2 users. Vaping urges/withdrawal were reduced following 10 puffs, 
with no significant differences between device groups.
DISCUSSION: Under normal use conditions, both G2 and G3 devices deliver 
cigarette-like amounts of nicotine, but G3 devices matched the amount and speed 
of nicotine delivery of a conventional cigarette. Compared with cigarettes, G2 
and G3 e-cigarettes resulted in significantly lower levels of exposure to a 
potent lung carcinogen and cardiovascular toxicant. These findings have 
significant implications for understanding the addiction potential of these 
devices and their viability/suitability as aids to smoking cessation.

We present prospective blood pressure (BP) and hear rate (HR) changes in smokers 
invited to switch to e-cigarettes in the ECLAT study. BP and HR changes were 
compared among (1) different study groups (users of high, low, and zero nicotine 
products) and (2) pooled continuous smoking phenotype classification (same 
phenotype from week 12 to -52), with participants classified as quitters 
(completely quit smoking), reducers (≥50% reduction in smoking consumption) and 
failures (<50% or no reduction in smoking consumption). Additionally, the latter 
comparison was repeated in a subgroup of participants with elevated BP at 
baseline. No significant changes were observed among study groups for systolic 
BP, diastolic BP, and HR. In 145 subjects with a continuous smoking phenotype, 
we observed lower systolic BP at week 52 compared to baseline but no effect of 
smoking phenotype classification. When the same analysis was repeated in 66 
subjects with elevated BP at baseline, a substantial reduction in systolic BP 
was observed at week 52 compared to baseline (132.4 ± 12.0 vs. 141.2 ± 10.5 
mmHg, p < 0.001), with a significant effect found for smoking phenotype 
classification. After adjusting for weight change, gender and age, reduction in 
systolic BP from baseline at week 52 remains associated significantly with both 
smoking reduction and smoking abstinence. In conclusion, smokers who reduce or 
quit smoking by switching to e-cigarettes may lower their systolic BP in the 
long term, and this reduction is apparent in smokers with elevated BP. The 
current study adds to the evidence that quitting smoking with the use of 
e-cigarettes does not lead to higher BP values, and this is independently 
observed whether e-cigarettes are regularly used or not.

BACKGROUND: Electronic cigarettes have been developed and marketed in recent 
years as smoking substitutes. However, no studies have evaluated their effects 
on the cardiovascular system. The purpose of this study was to examine the 
immediate effects of electronic cigarette use on left ventricular (LV) function, 
compared to the well-documented acute adverse effects of smoking.
METHODS: Echocardiographic examinations were performed in 36 healthy heavy 
smokers (SM, age 36 ± 5 years) before and after smoking 1 cigarette and in 40 
electronic cigarette users (ECIG, age 35 ± 5 years) before and after using the 
device with "medium-strength" nicotine concentration (11 mg/ml) for 7 minutes. 
Mitral flow diastolic velocities (E, A), their ratio (E/A), deceleration time 
(DT), isovolumetric relaxation time (IVRT) and corrected-to-heart rate IVRT 
(IVRTc) were measured. Mitral annulus systolic (Sm), and diastolic (Em, Am) 
velocities were estimated. Myocardial performance index was calculated from 
Doppler flow (MPI) and tissue Doppler (MPIt). Longitudinal deformation 
measurements of global strain (GS), systolic (SRs) and diastolic (SRe, SRa) 
strain rate were also performed.
RESULTS: Baseline measurements were similar in both groups. In SM, IVRT and 
IVRTc were prolonged, Em and SRe were decreased, and both MPI and MPIt were 
elevated after smoking. In ECIG, no differences were observed after device use. 
Comparing after-use measurements, ECIG had higher Em (P = 0.032) and SRe 
(P = 0.022), and lower IVRTc (P = 0.011), MPI (P = 0.001) and MPIt (P = 0.019). 
The observed differences were significant even after adjusting for changes in 
heart rate and blood pressure.
CONCLUSIONS: Although acute smoking causes a delay in myocardial relaxation, 
electronic cigarette use has no immediate effects. Electronic cigarettes' role 
in tobacco harm reduction should be studied intensively in order to determine 
whether switching to electronic cigarette use may have long-term beneficial 
effects on smokers' health.

Among Adults Who Smoke That Switch to Oral Nicotine Pouch Products Relative to 
Continuing Smoking or Stopping All Tobacco Use.

The purpose of this open-label, randomized, controlled, in-clinic, 
5-parallel-group study was to assess biomarkers of exposure (BoE) to select 
harmful and potentially harmful constituents in adults who smoke (N = 144) 
switching to oral tobacco products (on!® mint nicotine pouches; test products) 
compared to continuing smoking cigarettes (CS) and completely quitting all 
tobacco products (NT). Changes in 20 BoE to select harmful and potentially 
harmful constituents, including 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol 
(NNAL), were evaluated. Adult smokers smoked their usual brand of cigarettes for 
2 days (baseline assessments) and then were randomly assigned to ad libitum use 
of 2, 4, or 8 mg test products, CS, or NT for 7 days. Analysis of covariance was 
used to assess the Day 7 BoE levels between each group using test products, CS, 
and NT. The creatinine-adjusted total urinary NNAL and other 18 of 19 BoE levels 
(except nicotine equivalents [NEs]) were significantly lower (P < .05) on Day 7, 
among all test product groups compared to CS. Geometric least-square means were 
reduced for all biomarkers of exposure, except NEs, in test product groups by 
approximately 42%-96% compared to the CS group, and reductions were comparable 
to the NT group. The geometric least-square means for urinary NE between the 
test product and the CS groups, although not significantly different, the Day 7 
mean change relative to the CS group were 49.9%, 65.8%, and 101% for the 2, 4, 
and 8 mg test product groups, respectively. The substantial reduction in harmful 
and potentially harmful constituent exposure suggests complete switching from 
cigarettes to test products may present a harm reduction opportunity for adults 
who smoke.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship between metabolic syndrome (MetS) and 
cognitive impairment in elderly patients with white matter lesions (WML).
METHODS: From -January 2016 to June 2017, a cross-sectional study was conducted 
on the clinical data of 358 WML patients over 65 years old in the Department of 
Neurology of the Daping Hospital. Mini-mental state examination scales were used 
to evaluate the cognitive function of the patients, and the cognitive impairment 
was diagnosed and grouped according to the scoring and diagnostic criteria. All 
WML patients were divided into the cognitive impairment group and normal 
cognition group. Clinical data of age, sex, education level, body mass index, 
abdominal circumference, smoking and alcohol consumption, blood pressure, 
fasting blood glucose, triglyceride (TG) and high-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (HDL-C) were collected. Multivariate logistic regression analyses 
were performed to examine the relationship between MetS and cognitive impairment 
in WML patients.
RESULTS: Compared with the normal cognition group, the proportion of MetS in the 
cognitive impairment group was significantly higher (χ2 = 11.211, p < 0.01), the 
proportion of MetS components such as elevated blood pressure, elevated blood 
glucose, elevated TG, decreased HDL-C and abdominal obesity in the cognitive 
impairment group was also higher (p < 0.01 or p < 0.05). After adjustment for 
age, sex, low education level, current smoking, daily drinking, severity of WML, 
MetS, and its components, multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that 
MetS was an independent risk factor for cognitive impairment in WML patients (OR 
3.32, 95% CI 1.31-5.19). In addition, The greater the number of MetS components, 
the higher the risk of cognitive impairment in WML patients (ptrend < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: MetS is an independent risk factor for cognitive impairment in 
patients with WML.

BACKGROUND: Novel tobacco products entering the US market include electronic 
cigarettes (ECIGs) and products advertised to "heat, not burn" tobacco. There is 
a growing literature regarding the acute effects of ECIGs. Less is known about 
"heat, not burn" products. This study's purpose was to expand existing clinical 
laboratory methods to examine, in cigarette smokers, the acute effects of a 
"heat, not burn" "loose-leaf tobacco vaporizer" (LLTV).
METHODS: Plasma nicotine and breath carbon monoxide (CO) concentration and 
tobacco abstinence symptom severity were measured before and after two 10-puff 
(30-s interpuff interval) product use bouts separated by 60min. LLTV effects 
were compared to participants' own brand (OB) cigarettes and an ECIG (3.3V; 
1.5ohm; 18mg/ml nicotine).
RESULTS: Relative to OB, LLTV increased plasma nicotine concentration to a 
lesser degree, did not increase CO, and did not appear to reduce abstinence 
symptoms as effectively. Relative to ECIG, LLTV nicotine and CO delivery and 
abstinence symptom suppression did not differ. Participants reported that both 
the LLTV and ECIG were significantly less satisfying than OB.
CONCLUSIONS: Results demonstrate that LLTVs are capable of delivering nicotine 
and suppressing tobacco abstinence symptoms partially; acute effects of these 
products can be evaluated using existing clinical laboratory methods. Results 
can inform tobacco product regulation and may be predictive of the extent that 
these products have the potential to benefit or harm overall public health.

INTRODUCTION: Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) allows for assessment of 
electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) use in real-time. This EMA study 
aimed to 1) describe study participation rates; 2) evaluate the concordance of 
EMA and survey items measuring frequency and quantity of ENDS use; and 3) assess 
the relationships between EMA items measuring frequency and quantity of ENDS use 
with ENDS dependence, measured at baseline and with saliva cotinine collected at 
follow-up.
METHODS: Fifty young adult ENDS users completed baseline surveys, EMAs (i.e., 
random, event-based, daily diaries), and follow-up questionnaires over a 14-day 
period. Spearman correlations were conducted to determine concordance of survey 
items. Linear regression models assessed the relationships between EMA ENDS use 
characteristics (e.g., puffs, number of days used, quantity of e-liquid) with 
dependence items at baseline and saliva cotinine at follow-up.
RESULTS: Overall completion for the prompted EMAs (random and daily diaries) was 
68%. Correlations between EMA measures assessing ENDS use ranged from weak 
(ρ = -0.02; NS) to strong (ρ = 0.69, p < .001); EMA to follow-up items ranged 
from weak (ρ = 0.16; p < .05) to moderate (ρ = 0.54; p < .001). Significant 
associations were found between ENDS use measured via random and daily diary 
EMAs and saliva cotinine at follow-up after controlling for cigarette smoking 
(B = 0.70-1.76; p < .01), but not for event-based EMAs. Items measuring 
frequency/quantity of use from random EMAs were consistently associated with 
ENDS dependence at baseline (B = 0.74-1.58; p < .01).
CONCLUSION: EMA represents a promising methodology to capture real-time ENDS use 
behaviors, primarily through daily diary and random EMAs.

MDMB-4F-BICA, also known as 4F-MDMB-BICA, is a new psychoactive substance that 
emerged in 2020. It is often illegally added to electronic cigarette oil for 
inhalation abuse, leading to serious adverse symptoms and even death. There are 
significant differences in pharmacokinetics between inhalation administration 
and conventional drug delivery methods. Inhalation administration can pass 
through the blood-brain barrier to enter the brain directly. However, the 
specific distribution of the drug in the brain following inhalation has not been 
well investigated. In order to scientifically compare the absorption and 
distribution of MDMB-4F-BICA after two administration methods (inhalation and 
subcutaneous injection), this study analyzed the drug concentration in mice 
blood and brain by LC-MS/MS after systemic exposure inhalation in the form of 
electronic cigarettes. The aim was to conduct the pharmacokinetics study of 
MDMB-4F-BICA after inhalation('vapor') administration. Pharmacokinetics and 
distribution of the compound revealed that the maximum concentrations in blood 
of this compound were reached at 0.5 min and 15 min, respectively, and the 
concentration in the brain reached the maximum at the same time after two modes 
of administration. The drug concentration in the brain was higher than that of 
subcutaneous injection, and the drug remained at a low concentration in the 
brain for a long period (20 ng/g brain tissue) with a significant distribution 
in several olfactory primary cortex brain regions. Taken together, the 
pharmacokinetics of the synthetic cannabinoid MDMB-4F-BICA after single systemic 
exposure inhalation were investigated for the first time in this study. A basis 
for subsequent evaluation research of inhalation-related harmfulness is provided 
by comparing the distribution of drugs in the brain after the two administration 
modes.

Smoking is widely recognized as a significant risk factor in the progression of 
arterial stiffness and cardiovascular diseases. Valuable information related to 
cardiac arrhythmias and heart function can be obtained by analyzing biosignals 
such as the electrocardiogram (ECG) and the photoplethysmogram (PPG). The PPG 
signal is a non-invasive optical technique that can be used to evaluate the 
changes in blood volume, and thus it can be linked to the health of the vascular 
system.Objective. In this study, the impact of three smoking habits-cigarettes, 
shisha, and electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes)-on the features of the PPG 
signal were investigated.Approach. The PPG signals are measured for 45 healthy 
smokers before, during, and after the smoking session and then processed to 
extract the morphological features. Quantitative statistical techniques were 
used to analyze the PPG features and provide the most significant features of 
the three smoking habits. The impact of smoking is observed through significant 
changes in the features of the PPG signal, indicating blood volume 
instability.Main results. The results revealed that the three smoking habits 
influence the characteristics of the PPG signal significantly, which 
presentseven after 15 min of smoking. Among them, shisha has the greatest impact 
on PPG features, particularly on heart rate, systolic time, augmentation index, 
and peak pulse interval change. In contrast, e-cigarettes have the least effect 
on PPG features. Interestingly, smoking electronic cigarettes, which many 
participants use as a substitute for traditional cigarettes when attempting to 
quit smoking, has nearly a comparable effect to regular smoking.Significance. 
The findings suggest that individuals who smoke shisha are more likely to 
develop cardiovascular diseases at an earlier age compared to those who have 
other smoking habits. Understanding the variations in the PPG signal caused by 
smoking can aid in the early detection of cardiovascular disorders and provide 
insight into cardiac conditions. This ultimately contributes to the prevention 
of the development of cardiovascular diseases and the development of a health 
screening system.

A liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry 
(HPLC-ESI(+)-MS/MS) method for the analysis of the tobacco-specific carcinogens 
N'-nitrosonornicotine (NNN) and 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol 
(NNAL) and their glucuronides (total NNN and total NNAL) in human urine was 
developed. The method has excellent accuracy and intra-day and inter-day 
precision, and limits of quantitation of 0.015 and 0.075pmol/mL urine, 
respectively, for total NNN and total NNAL. A unique aspect of this method is 
internal assessment of possible artifactual formation of NNN by inclusion of the 
monitor amine [pyridine-D4]nornicotine. We found that artifactual formation of 
NNN comprised only 2.5% of the measured amounts of total NNN in urine of 
cigarette smokers, under our conditions using ammonium sulfamate as an inhibitor 
of nitrosation. The method was applied to urine samples from cigarette smokers 
and e-cigarette users. Levels of total NNN and total NNAL in the urine of 
cigarette smokers averaged 0.060±0.035pmol/mL and 2.41±1.41pmol/mL urine, 
(N=38), respectively, which were both significantly greater than in the urine of 
27 e-cigarette users.

Recent epidemiological data indicate that the popularity of electronic 
cigarettes (e-cigarettes), and consequently nicotine use, is rising in both 
adolescent and adult populations. As nicotine is a known developmental 
neurotoxin, these products present a potential threat for those exposed during 
early life stages. Despite this, few studies have evaluated the toxicity of 
e-cigarettes on the developing central nervous system. The goal of this study 
was to assess neurotoxicity resulting from early-life exposure to electronic 
cigarette aerosols in an in vivo model. Specifically, studies here focused on 
neuro-parameters related to neuroinflammation and neurotrophins. To accomplish 
this, pregnant and neonatal C57BL/6 mice were exposed to aerosols produced from 
classic tobacco flavor e-cigarette cartridges (with [13 mg/ml] and without 
nicotine) during gestation (∼3 weeks) and lactation (∼3 weeks) via whole-body 
inhalation. Exposure to e-cigarette aerosols with and without nicotine caused 
significant reductions in hippocampal gene expression of Ngfr and Bdnf, as well 
as in serum levels of cytokines IL-1β, IL-2, and IL-6. Exposure to e-cigarette 
aerosols without nicotine enhanced expression of Iba-1, a specific marker of 
microglia, in the cornus ammonis 1 region of the hippocampus. Overall, our novel 
results indicate that exposure to e-cigarette aerosols, with and without 
nicotine, poses a considerable risk to the developing central nervous system. 
Consequently, e-cigarettes should be considered a potential public health 
threat, especially early in life, requiring further research and policy 
considerations.

INTRODUCTION: Electronic cigarettes e-cigarettes aerosolize a liquid solution 
often containing nicotine. e-cigarette nicotine delivery may be influenced by 
user puffing behaviors ("puff topography"). E-cigarette puff topography can be 
recorded using mouthpiece-based computerized systems. The present study sought 
to examine the extent to which these systems influence e-cigarette nicotine 
delivery and other e-cigarette associated acute effects under ad libitum use 
conditions.
METHODS: Plasma nicotine concentration, heart rate, and subjective effects were 
assessed in 29 experienced e-cigarette users using their preferred e-cigarette 
battery and liquid (≥12mg/mL nicotine) in two sessions differing only by the 
presence of a mouthpiece-based device. In both sessions, participants completed 
a directed e-cigarette use bout (10 puffs, 30-s interpuff interval) and a 90-min 
ad libitum bout. Puff topography was recorded in the session with the topography 
mouthpiece.
RESULTS: Plasma nicotine, heart rate, and subjective effects, aside from "Did 
the e-cigarette Taste Good?" were independent of topography measurement (higher 
mean taste ratings were observed in the no topography condition). Mean (SEM) 
plasma nicotine concentration following the ad libitum bout was 34.3ng/mL (4.9) 
in the no topography condition and 35.7ng/mL (4.3) in the topography condition. 
Longer puff durations, longer interpuff intervals, and larger puff volumes were 
observed in the ad libitum relative to the directed bout.
CONCLUSIONS: E-cigarette use significantly increased plasma nicotine 
concentration and heart rate while suppressing abstinence symptoms. These 
effects did not differ when a topography mouthpiece was present. Future studies 
using ad libitum e-cigarette use bouts would facilitate understanding of 
e-cigarette toxicant yield.
IMPLICATIONS: No prior study has examined whether mouthpiece-based topography 
recording devices influence e-cigarette associated nicotine delivery, heart 
rate, or subjective effects under ad libitum conditions or assessed ad libitum 
puff topography in experienced individuals using their preferred e-cigarette 
battery and liquid with a mouthpiece-based computerized device. E-cigarette use 
significantly increased plasma nicotine concentration and heart rate while 
suppressing abstinence symptoms. These effects did not differ when a topography 
mouthpiece was present. Ad libitum puff topography differed from puff topography 
recorded during directed puffing. These findings suggest that future studies 
using ad libitum use bouts would facilitate better understanding of e-cigarette 
toxicant yield.

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. In this study, 
we assessed factors related to cardiovascular disease risk and outcomes among 
sexual minorities (SM). Data from multiple waves of the PATH study were used in 
this analysis. Multivariable regression models were used to assess the 
association between sexual identity and: tobacco or e-cigarette use, adverse 
cardiovascular events, and age at first diagnosis of adverse cardiovascular 
disease events. In our sample (N = 23,205), 1,660 (7.15%) participants 
identified as SM. SM men, relative to heterosexual men, are more likely to be 
diagnosed with high blood pressure (aRR = 1.27; 95% CI 1.10, 1.47), high 
cholesterol (aRR = 1.32; 95% CI: 1.12, 1.55), congestive heart failure 
(aRR = 2.29; 95% CI 1.13, 4.65), stroke (aRR = 2.39; 95% CI: 1.14, 5.04), heart 
attack (aRR = 2.40; 95% CI 1.42, 4.04), and other heart conditions (aRR = 1.52; 
95% CI: 1.06, 2.18). Although no simple differences were observed among SM women 
compared to heterosexual women, SM women were more likely to be diagnosed at a 
younger age for high blood pressure (aRR = -0.69; 95% CI - 1.08, - 0.29), high 
cholesterol (aRR = -0.77; 95% CI - 1.15, - 0.38), stroke (aRR =  - 1.04; 95% 
CI - 1.94, - 0.13), and heart attack (aRR =  - 1.26; 95% CI - 2.42, - 0.10). SM 
men were only diagnosed at a younger age for stroke (aRR =  - 1.18; 95% 
CI - 2.06, - 0.30). Compared to heterosexuals, sexual minorities are at higher 
risk for cardiovascular disease, more likely to develop cardiovascular disease 
at an earlier age, and more likely to use tobacco products. Future research 
should focus on decreasing cardiovascular risk among sexual minorities including 
reducing tobacco use and stress. Screening recommendations for sexual minority 
populations should also be reviewed in light of a growing body of literature 
suggesting elevated risk from a young age.

The outbreak of vaping-related severe lung injuries and deaths and the epidemic 
of teen vaping in the U.S. underscore the urgent need for determining the 
biological consequences of electronic cigarette (e-cig) use. We have 
investigated the association between vaping and epigenetic changes by 
quantifying DNA methylation levels in Long Interspersed Nucleotide Element 1 
(LINE-1) and global DNA hydroxymethylation (5-hmC) levels and measuring the 
expression level of enzymes catalysing the respective processes in peripheral 
blood of exclusive vapers, smokers, and controls, matched for age, gender, and 
race (n = 45). Both vapers and smokers showed significant loss of methylation in 
LINE-1 repeat elements in comparison to controls (P = 0.00854 and P = 0.03078, 
respectively). Similarly, vapers and smokers had significant reductions in 5-hmC 
levels relative to controls (P = 0.04884 and P = 0.0035, respectively). Neither 
the LINE-1 methylation levels nor the global 5-hmC levels were different between 
vapers and smokers. There was a direct correlation between methylation levels in 
the LINE-1 elements and global 5-hmC levels in the study subjects (r = 0.31696, 
P = 0.03389). Inverse and statistically significant correlations were found 
between both the LINE-1 methylation levels and the global 5-hmC levels and 
various vaping/smoking metrics in the study subjects. There were modest but not 
statistically significant changes in transcription of DNA methyltransferases and 
ten-eleven translocation enzymes in both vapers and smokers relative to 
controls. Our findings support follow-up genome-wide investigations into the 
epigenetic effects of vaping, which may further clarify the health consequences 
of e-cig use.

PURPOSE: The study objective was to describe and compare changes in newly funded 
National Institutes of Health (NIH) tobacco-related awards between fiscal year 
(FY) 2006 and FY2016.
DESIGN: Secondary analysis of NIH data.
SETTING: National Institutes of Health Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tool 
database was used.
SUBJECTS: National Institutes of Health tobacco-related awards newly funded 
during FY2006 and FY2016.
MEASURES: Search terms included tobacco, smoking, nicotine, secondhand smoke, 
and e-cigarettes. Grants and funding amounts were retrieved.
ANALYSIS: We calculated frequency distributions to determine the number and 
percentage of total NIH grants funded overall and by specific institute, and 
inflation-adjusted total and median funding amounts. We computed percentage 
differences in number of new grants, funding amounts, and percentage of funding 
allocated overall, and by institute.
RESULTS: There was a 187% increase in the percentage of total NIH funding 
allocated to new tobacco-related awards from 0.09% in FY2006 to 0.25% in FY2016. 
Total number of awards increased by 67% in FY2016 (n = 144; $56 015 931) 
compared to FY2006 (n = 86; $22 076 987), and there was a 154% increase in 
inflation-adjusted total funding for tobacco control. The top funding institutes 
were National Institute on Drug Abuse and National Cancer Institute; National 
Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism was third in FY2006; and National, 
Heart, Lung and Blood Institute in FY2016. Research grants were the most 
frequently funded. Smoking cessation was a common topic area and increased by 
64%.
CONCLUSION: NIH funding is critical for advancing the science of nicotine and 
tobacco research.

INTRODUCTION: To evaluate how experienced dual users used cigarettes and 
e-cigarettes in real-world use and under different levels of cigarette 
availability.
METHODS: Dual users (cigarettes+e-cigarettes; n=74) and a smoke-only group (just 
cigarettes; n=74) engaged in a 26-day study with two ad lib use intervals, a 
week of 75% cigarette reduction and three days of 100% cigarette reduction. 
After a week of ad lib use of products, all participants were asked to reduce 
smoking by 75% (dual users were free to use their e-cigarettes as they wished), 
followed by another week of ad lib use. All participants were then asked to 
reduce smoking by 100% (cessation) for three days. Primary outcomes were 
biological samples (carbon monoxide, urinary nicotine and cotinine). 
Participants also provided real-time reports of product use, craving, and 
withdrawal symptoms using a smartphone app.
RESULTS: Dual users did not smoke fewer cigarettes than smoke-only participants 
during ad lib periods, but quadrupled their use of e-cigarettes during smoking 
reduction periods. Dual users were significantly more likely to maintain 100% 
reduction (97.1% vs. 81.2%). Amongst women, dual use was associated with higher 
nicotine levels and withdrawal suppression.
DISCUSSION: Among a group of experienced dual users, e-cigarettes helped 
maintain smoking reduction and reduced some withdrawal symptoms, although both 
withdrawal symptoms and nicotine levels varied as a function of gender.

BACKGROUND: Many smokers report using e-cigarettes to help them quit smoking, 
but whether e-cigarettes aid cessation efforts is uncertain.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether e-cigarette use after hospital discharge is 
associated with subsequent tobacco abstinence among smokers who plan to quit and 
are advised to use evidence-based treatment.
DESIGN: Secondary data analysis of a randomized controlled trial. 
(ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01714323 [parent trial]).
SETTING: 3 hospitals.
PARTICIPANTS: 1357 hospitalized adult cigarette smokers who planned to stop 
smoking, received tobacco cessation counseling in the hospital, and were 
randomly assigned at discharge to a tobacco treatment recommendation (control) 
or free tobacco treatment (intervention).
MEASUREMENTS: Self-reported e-cigarette use (exposure) was assessed 1 and 3 
months after discharge; biochemically validated tobacco abstinence (outcome) was 
assessed 6 months after discharge.
RESULTS: Twenty-eight percent of participants used an e-cigarette within 3 
months after discharge. In an analysis of 237 propensity score-matched pairs, 
e-cigarette users were less likely than nonusers to abstain from tobacco use at 
6 months (10.1% vs. 26.6%; risk difference, -16.5% [95% CI, -23.3% to -9.6%]). 
The association between e-cigarette use and quitting varied between intervention 
patients, who were given easy access to conventional treatment (7.7% vs. 29.8%; 
risk difference, -22.1% [CI, -32.3% to -11.9%]), and control patients, who 
received only treatment recommendations (12.0% vs. 24.1%; risk difference, 
-12.0% [CI, -21.2% to 2.9%]) (P for interaction = 0.143).
LIMITATIONS: Patients self-selected e-cigarette use. Unmeasured confounding is 
possible in an observational study.
CONCLUSION: During 3 months after hospital discharge, more than a quarter of 
smokers attempting to quit used e-cigarettes, mostly to aid cessation, but few 
used them regularly. This pattern of use was associated with less tobacco 
abstinence at 6 months than among smokers who did not use e-cigarettes. 
Additional study is needed to determine whether regular use of e-cigarettes aids 
or hinders smoking cessation.

METHODS: Timed-pregnant C57BL/6J mice were exposed to 2.4% nicotine in propylene 
glycol (PG) or 0% nicotine /PG once a day from gestational day 15 until 
delivery. After delivery, offspring and mothers were exposed to E-cigarette 
vapors for an additional 14 days from postnatal day 2 through 16. Following 
their last exposure serum cotinine levels were measured in female juvenile mice. 
Male mice underwent behavioral testing at 14 weeks of age to assess 
sensorimotor, affective, and cognitive functional domains.
RESULTS: Adult male mice exposed to 2.4% nicotine/PG E-cigarette vapors had 
significantly more head dips in the zero maze test and higher levels of rearing 
activity in the open field test compared to 0% nicotine/PG exposed mice and 
untreated controls. In the water maze test after reversal training, the 2.4% 
nicotine/PG mice spent more than 25% of time in the new location whereas the 
other groups did not.
CONCLUSION: Adult male mice exhibited increased levels of activity in the zero 
maze and open field tests when exposed to E-cigarette vapor containing nicotine 
during late prenatal and early postnatal life. These findings indicate that 
nicotine exposure from E-cigarettes may cause persistent behavioral changes when 
exposure occurs during a period of rapid brain growth.

CONTEXT: Electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use is growing within the United 
States, resulting in both intentional and unintentional exposures to 
concentrated liquid nicotine or "e-liquid." Nicotine has been culpable for 
severe poisoning and deaths in the past. However, sources of nicotine have 
traditionally been from cigarettes, cigars, or pesticides. Fatalities due to 
liquid nicotine are rare, and fatalities following ingestion of e-liquid are 
even scarcer.
CASE: We present a case of a 24-year-old woman who intentionally ingested up to 
3000 mg of liquid nicotine intended for e-cigarette use. She was found in 
pulseless electrical activity and had return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) 
after undergoing approximately 10 min of cardiopulmonary resuscitation with a 
blood pressure of 74/53 mmHg and a pulse rate of 106 beats/min. Despite 
aggressive supportive care, she ultimately died after she was found to have 
multiple acute infarcts, consistent with severe anoxic brain injury, on magnetic 
resonance imaging. The patient's toxicologic testing, obtained shortly after 
ROSC, was notable for plasma nicotine and cotinine levels each >1000 ng/mL.
DISCUSSION: This fatality highlights the potential toxicity associated with 
suicidal ingestion of liquid nicotine.

The objective of this experiment was to evaluate the comparative value of 
cigarettes versus high dose e-cigarettes among nicotine-dependent cigarette 
smokers when compared with money or use of their usual cigarette brand. The 
experiment used a within-subject design with four sessions. After baseline 
assessment, participants attended two 15-min unrestricted smoking sessions: one 
cigarette smoking session and one e-cigarette smoking session. Participants then 
attended two multiple-choice procedure (MCP) sessions: a session comparing 
cigarettes and money and a session comparing e-cigarettes and money. 
Participants (n=27) had used cigarettes regularly, had never used e-cigarettes, 
and were not currently attempting to quit smoking. The sample consisted 
primarily of males (72%), with a mean age of 34 years. When given the 
opportunity to choose between smoking a cigarette or an e-cigarette, 
participants chose the cigarette 73.9% of the time. Findings from the MCP 
demonstrated that after the first e-cigarette exposure sessions, the crossover 
value for cigarettes ($3.45) was significantly higher compared with the 
crossover value for e-cigarettes ($2.73). The higher participant preference, 
self-reported smoking effects, and higher MCP crossover points indicate that 
cigarettes have a higher comparative value than high dose e-cigarettes among 
e-cigarette naive smokers.

BACKGROUND: Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) have become increasingly 
popular, yet beyond social or technical features, the specific health-related 
reasons adults use e-cigarettes remain poorly understood.
OBJECTIVE: To explore the cross-sectional associations between perceived health 
and current e-cigarette use in a large population-based cohort.
METHODS: From the participants included in the French CONSTANCES cohort (a large 
general-purpose national population-based cohort) from 2015 to 2017, we included 
18,300 ever tobacco smokers with data on their e-cigarette use. We used logistic 
regressions to estimate the associations between e-cigarette use and perceived 
health (global and respiratory), stratifying on participants' smoking status and 
adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics. To examine the role of objective 
health features (reported diagnoses and measured parameters during a health 
examination), we adjusted for prior history of respiratory and cardiovascular 
diseases, diabetes, cancer, spirometry, and blood pressure. Finally, we examined 
the effect of additionally adjusting for several health-related behaviors.
RESULTS: Participants with poor perceived health (global and respiratory) were 
at greater risk of e-cigarette use. These associations remained unchanged after 
adjustment for objective health features and health-related behaviors (e.g., in 
current smokers, for global perceived health, an odds ratio of 1.10 [95% CI 
1.03-1.16] per increase on an 8-point scale from very good to very poor).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the more current and former smokers felt 
unhealthy, the more they tended to currently use e-cigarettes. People who 
regularly use e-cigarettes should obtain medical supervision that takes into 
account not only objective diagnoses and measurements but also perceived health. 
Counseling practices could include assessing perceived health status to 
reinforce motivation to quit smoking.

BACKGROUND: Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are popular alternatives to 
conventional cigarettes among adult smokers wishing to reduce their exposure to 
harmful smoke constituents. However, little information exists on the relative 
internal exposures resulting from the exclusive or dual use of e-cigarettes.
METHODS: Measurements of product use; adverse events; changes in smoking urge; 
and blood, urine and exhaled breath biomarkers of exposure (BoE) representing 
toxicants believed to contribute to smoking related diseases were made at 
baseline and after five days of product use in 105 clinically-confined smokers 
randomized into groups that partially or completely substituted their usual 
brand combustible cigarette with commercial e-cigarettes, or discontinued all 
nicotine and tobacco products.
RESULTS: Subjects switching to e-cigarettes had significantly lower levels 
(29 %-95 %) of urinary BoEs after 5 days. Nicotine equivalents declined by 
25 %-40 %. Dual users who substituted half of their self-reported daily 
cigarette consumption with e-cigarettes experienced 7 %-38 % reductions, but had 
increases (1 %-20 %) in nicotine equivalents. Blood nicotine biomarker levels 
were lower in the cessation (75 %-96 %) and e-cigarette use groups (11 %-83 %); 
dual users had no significant reductions. All groups experienced significant 
decreases in exhaled CO (27 %-89 %). Exhaled NO increases (46 %-63 %) were 
observed in the cessation and e-cigarette use groups; dual users had minimal 
changes. By Day 5, all groups had greater reductions in smoking urge compared to 
cessation. However, reductions were larger in the dual use group. No serious 
adverse events were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Exposures to harmful smoke toxicants were observed to be lower in 
smokers who completely or partially replaced their cigarettes with e-cigarettes 
over five days.

Electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use emits potentially hazardous compounds and 
deteriorates indoor air quality. Home is a place where e-cigarettes may 
frequently be used amid its increasing prohibition in public places. This study 
assessed the real-life scenario of bystanders' exposure to secondhand 
e-cigarette aerosol (SHA) at home. A one-week observational study was conducted 
within the TackSHS project in four countries (Greece, Italy, Spain, and the 
United Kingdom) in 2019 including: 1) homes of e-cigarette users living together 
with a non-user/non-smoker; and 2) control homes with no smokers nor e-cigarette 
users. Indoor airborne nicotine, PM2.5, and PM1.0 concentrations were measured 
as environmental markers of SHA. Biomarkers, including nicotine and its 
metabolites, tobacco-specific nitrosamines, propanediol, glycerol, and metals 
were measured in participants' saliva and urine samples. E-cigarette use 
characteristics, such as e-cigarette refill liquid's nicotine concentration, 
e-cigarette type, place of e-cigarette use at home, and frequency of 
ventilation, were also collected. A total of 29 e-cigarette users' homes and 21 
control homes were included. The results showed that the seven-day 
concentrations of airborne nicotine were quantifiable in 21 (72.4 %) out of 29 
e-cigarette users' homes; overall, they were quite low (geometric mean: 0.01 
μg/m3; 95 % CI: 0.01-0.02 μg/m3) and were all below the limit of quantification 
in control homes. Seven-day concentrations of PM2.5 and PM1.0 in e-cigarette and 
control homes were similar. Airborne nicotine and PM concentrations did not 
differ according to different e-cigarette use characteristics. Non-users 
residing with e-cigarette users had low but significantly higher levels of 
cotinine, 3'-OH-cotinine and 1,2-propanediol in saliva, and cobalt in urine than 
non-users living in control homes. In conclusion, e-cigarette use at home 
created bystanders' exposure to SHA regardless of the e-cigarette use 
characteristics. Further studies are warranted to assess the implications of SHA 
exposure for smoke-free policy.

Tobacco smoke extracts prepared from both mainstream and sidestream smoking have 
been associated with heightened platelet activation, aggregation, adhesion, and 
inflammation. Conversely, it has been shown that pure nicotine inhibits similar 
platelet functions. In this work, we 1) evaluated the effects of e-cigarette 
extracts on platelet activities and 2) elucidated the differences between the 
nicotine-dependent and non-nicotine dependent (e.g. fine particulate matter or 
toxic compounds) effects of tobacco and e-cigarette products on platelet 
activities. To accomplish these goals, platelets from healthy volunteers (n = 
50) were exposed to tobacco smoke extracts, e-cigarette vapor extracts, and pure 
nicotine and changes in platelet activation, adhesion, aggregation, and 
inflammation were evaluated, using optical aggregation, flow cytometry, and 
ELISA methods. Interestingly, the exposure of platelets to e-vapor extracts 
induced a significant up-regulation in the expression of the pro-inflammatory 
gC1qR and cC1qR and induced a marked increase in the deposition of C3b as 
compared with traditional tobacco smoke extracts. Similarly, platelet 
activation, as measured by a prothrombinase based assay, and platelet 
aggregation were also significantly enhanced after exposure to e-vapor extracts. 
Finally, platelet adhesion potential toward fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, 
and other platelets was also enhanced after exposure to e-cigarette vapor 
extracts. In the presence of pure nicotine, platelet functions were observed to 
be inhibited, which further suggests that other constituents of tobacco smoke 
and electronic vapor can antagonize platelet functions, however, the presence of 
nicotine in extracts somewhat perpetuated the platelet functional changes in a 
dose-dependent manner.

The toxicity of a mentholated version of the Tobacco Heating System (THS2.2M), a 
candidate modified risk tobacco product (MRTP), was characterized in a 90-day 
OECD inhalation study. Differential gene and protein expression analysis of 
nasal epithelium and lung tissue was also performed to record exposure effects 
at the molecular level. Rats were exposed to filtered air (sham), to THS2.2M (at 
15, 23 and 50 μg nicotine/l), to two mentholated reference cigarettes (MRC) (at 
23 μg nicotine/l), or to the 3R4F reference cigarette (at 23 μg nicotine/l). 
MRCs were designed to meet 3R4F specifications. Test atmosphere analyses 
demonstrated that aldehydes were reduced by 75%-90% and carbon monoxide by 98% 
in THS2.2M aerosol compared with MRC smoke; aerosol uptake was confirmed by 
carboxyhemoglobin and menthol concentrations in blood, and by the quantities of 
urinary nicotine metabolites. Systemic toxicity and alterations in the 
respiratory tract were significantly lower in THS2.2M-exposed rats compared with 
MRC and 3R4F. Pulmonary inflammation and the magnitude of the changes in gene 
and protein expression were also dramatically lower after THS2.2M exposure 
compared with MRCs and 3R4F. No menthol-related effects were observed after MRC 
mainstream smoke-exposure compared with 3R4F.

BACKGROUND Having painful intermittent penile erections that last less than 4 h 
is known as stuttering priapism. Sickle cell disease is a well-known risk for 
stuttering priapism; although, other causes could be related to this disorder. 
To date, no study has examined the relationship between stuttering priapism and 
electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes). CASE REPORT We present a case of a 
31-year-old man who came to our clinic with recurrent stuttering priapism. He 
had no chronic medical illnesses. He had smoked half a pack of cigarettes per 
day for the past 6 years but had shifted to vaping e-cigarettes for which he 
used several e-fluids and brands. His stuttering priapism started approximately 
1 week after he began vaping. A detailed history and physical examination were 
unremarkable. Laboratory results showed a normal complete blood count and 
metabolic panel along with a normal testosterone level and negative sickle cell 
screening test. The chest X-ray and abdominal and pelvic ultrasound were normal. 
Initially, we reassured the patient; however, his condition persisted with no 
significant changes in his general health or lifestyle. We asked him to stop 
using e-cigarettes, and after he stopped, his stuttering priapism surprisingly 
completely resolved. He has not experienced a single episode of stuttering 
priapism in the 3 months since the cessation of e-cigarettes use. CONCLUSIONS 
The relationship between stuttering priapism and e-cigarettes remains largely 
unexplored in the literature. Whether e-cigarettes and e-fluids represent a risk 
factor for priapism in novice e-cigarette smokers warrants further 
investigation.

Although substantial evidence shows that smoking is positively and robustly 
associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD), the CVD risk associated with the 
use of new and emerging tobacco products, such as electronic cigarettes, hookah, 
and heat-not-burn products, remains unclear. This uncertainty stems from lack of 
knowledge on how the use of these products affects cardiovascular health. 
Cardiovascular injury associated with the use of new tobacco products could be 
evaluated by measuring changes in biomarkers of cardiovascular harm that are 
sensitive to the use of combustible cigarettes. Such cardiovascular injury could 
be indexed at several levels. Preclinical changes contributing to the 
pathogenesis of disease could be monitored by measuring changes in systemic 
inflammation and oxidative stress, organ-specific dysfunctions could be gauged 
by measuring endothelial function (flow-mediated dilation), platelet 
aggregation, and arterial stiffness, and organ-specific injury could be 
evaluated by measuring endothelial microparticles and platelet-leukocyte 
aggregates. Classical risk factors, such as blood pressure, circulating 
lipoproteins, and insulin resistance, provide robust estimates of risk, and 
subclinical disease progression could be followed by measuring coronary artery 
Ca2+ and carotid intima-media thickness. Given that several of these biomarkers 
are well-established predictors of major cardiovascular events, the association 
of these biomarkers with the use of new and emerging tobacco products could be 
indicative of both individual and population-level CVD risk associated with the 
use of these products. Differential effects of tobacco products (conventional 
vs. new and emerging products) on different indexes of cardiovascular injury 
could also provide insights into mechanisms by which they induce cardiovascular 
harm.

Objective: Ethanol is used as a solvent for flavoring chemicals in some 
electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) liquids (e-liquids). However, there are 
limited data available regarding the effects of inhalation of ethanol on blood 
alcohol concentration (BAC) during e-cigarette use. In this study, a modified 
physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for inhalation of ethanol was 
used to estimate the BAC time-profile of e-cigarette users who puffed an 
e-liquid containing 23.5% ethanol. Materials and Methods: A modified PBPK model 
for inhalation of ethanol was developed. Use characteristics were estimated 
based on first-generation and second-generation e-cigarette topography 
parameters. Three representative use-case puffing profiles were modeled: a user 
that took many, short puffs; a typical user with intermediate puff counts and 
puff durations; and a user that took fewer, long puffs. Results and Discussion: 
The estimated peak BACs for these three user profiles were 0.22, 0.22, and 
0.30 mg/L for first-generation devices, respectively, and 0.85, 0.58, and 
0.34 mg/L for second-generation devices, respectively. Additionally, peak BACs 
for individual first-generation users with directly measured puffing parameters 
were estimated to range from 0.06 to 0.67 mg/L. None of the scenarios modeled 
predicted a peak BAC result that approached toxicological or regulatory 
thresholds that would be associated with physiological impairment (roughly 0.01% 
or 100 mg/L). Conclusions: The approach used in this study, combining a 
validated PBPK model for a toxicant with peer-reviewed topographical parameters, 
can serve as a screening-level exposure assessment useful for evaluation of the 
safety of e-liquid formulations. Abbreviations: BAC: blood alcohol

OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between spending on electronic cigarettes 
(e-cigarettes) and disease symptoms compared with the relationship between 
30-day e-cigarette use and disease symptoms among adult cigarette smokers in the 
U.S.
METHODS: We analyzed data from the Tobacco and Attitudes Beliefs Survey which 
included 533 respondents aged 24+ who were current cigarette smokers and 
e-cigarette ever users. Fifteen self-reported disease symptoms were included as 
outcome variables. Separate multivariable logistic regression models were 
estimated for each disease symptom with total spending on e-cigarettes in the 
past 30 days and with reported 30-day e-cigarette use. All models controlled for 
cigarettes smoked per day (CPD) and sociodemographic characteristics.
RESULTS: We found that those who spent more on e-cigarettes were more likely to 
report chest pain (AOR = 1.25, 95% CI 1.02-1.52), to notice blood when brushing 
their teeth (AOR = 1.23, 95% CI 1.02-1.49), to have sores or ulcers in their 
mouth (AOR = 1.36, 95% CI 1.08-1.72), and to have more than one cold (AOR = 
1.36, 95% CI 1.05-1.78) than those with no spending on e-cigarettes in the past 
30 days in an adjusted analysis. After controlling for CPD and other covariates, 
there were no significant relationships between 30-day e-cigarette use and 
symptoms. Even after controlling for CPD, e-cigarette expenditures or use was 
associated with greater odds of wheezing and shortness of breath.
CONCLUSIONS: E-cigarette expenditures might be a more useful measure of 
intensity of e-cigarette use. The additional health effect of e-cigarette use or 
expenditures among smokers independent of the effect of CPD suggests that 
e-cigarette use adds adverse health effects even among cigarette smokers.

BACKGROUND: Modified risk tobacco products (MRTP) can reduce harm by decreasing 
exposure to combustion-related toxicants. In the absence of epidemiologic data, 
biomarkers of potential harm (BoPH) are useful to evaluate the harm-reducing 
potential of MRTPs. This study evaluated whether arachidonic acid (AA)-derived 
metabolites serve as short-term BoPH for predicting harm reduction in tobacco 
product-switching studies.
METHODS: We used 24-hour urine samples from participants in a series of 
short-term studies in which smokers switched from combustible to noncombustible 
tobacco products [oral smokeless tobacco products or electronic nicotine 
delivery system (ENDS)] or abstinence. Pre- and postswitching samples were 
analyzed by LC/MS-MS for alterations in select AA metabolites, including 
prostaglandins, isoprostanes, thromboxanes, and leukotrienes.
RESULTS: Switching to abstinence, dual use of combustible and noncombustible 
products, or exclusive use of noncombustible products resulted in reduced 
2,3-d-TXB2 levels. Moreover, switching smokers to either abstinence or exclusive 
use of oral tobacco products resulted in reduced LTE4, but dual use of 
combustible and oral tobacco products or ENDS did not. A two-biomarker 
classification model comprising 2,3-d-TXB2 and LTE4 demonstrated the highest 
performance in distinguishing smokers switched to either abstinence or to ENDS 
and oral smokeless tobacco products.
CONCLUSIONS: Urinary 2,3-d-TXB2 and LTE4 can discriminate between combustible 
tobacco users and combustible tobacco users switched to either abstinence or 
noncombustible products for 5 days.
IMPACT: 2,3-d-TXB2 and LTE4, which are linked to platelet activation and 
inflammation, represent BoPH in short-term tobacco product-switching studies. 
Thus, from a regulatory perspective, 2,3-d-TXB2 and LTE4 may aid in assessing 
the harm reduction potential of MRTPs.

A man in his 50 s, who was found vomiting and in a disturbed state when the 
emergency medical team arrived, then went into cardiopulmonary arrest during 
transport and died without responding to resuscitation. The hospital initially 
suspected that the death may have been caused by internal causes, but since the 
deceased had previously been transported to the hospital in a suicide attempt, 
the hospital called police regarding suspicions of unnatural death. The police 
investigation revealed two empty bottles of nicotine liquid for e-cigarettes in 
his house and a search history of "nicotine suicide" on his cellphone. In a 
forensic autopsy, he was found to be highly obese, and abundant fat deposits 
were observed in his organs. A stent was placed in the aorta, but no abnormality 
was found. There was no obvious stenosis or obstruction in the coronary 
arteries. Drug screening using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry 
(LC-MS/MS) was performed on cardiac blood, urine, and stomach contents collected 
at autopsy, which revealed the presence of some medical products such as 
aripiprazole, nicotine, and cotinine. Further quantitative testing revealed high 
concentrations of nicotine in all samples. The left and right femoral venous 
blood concentrations were above the lethal dose, suggesting that arrhythmia or 
respiratory failure due to nicotine intoxication was the cause of death. With 
the widespread use of e-cigarettes, high concentrations of nicotine are readily 
available, and case reports of serious nicotine addiction are increasing. It is 
important to always consider addiction when conducting forensic evaluations in 
the medical field.

BACKGROUND: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and gestational diabetic 
nephropathy (GDN) have become an increasingly serious problem worldwide, which 
can cause a large number of adverse pregnancy consequences for mothers and 
infants. However, the diagnosis of GDM and GDN remains a challenge due to the 
lack of optimal biomarkers, and the examination has high requirements for 
patient compliance. We aimed to establish a simple early diagnostic model for 
GDM and GDN.
METHODS: We recruited 50 healthy pregnant (HP), 99 GDM patients, 99 GDN patients 
at Daping Hospital. Renal function indicators and blood cell indicators were 
collected for all patients.
RESULTS: Compared with HP, GDM, and GDN patients exhibited significantly higher 
urea/creatinine ratio and NEU. The diagnostic model1 based on the combination of 
urea/creatinine ratio and NEU was built using logistic regression. Based on 
receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the area under the curve (AUC) 
of the diagnostic model was 0.77 (0.7, 0.84) in distinguishing GDM from HP, and 
the AUC of the diagnostic model was 0.94 (0.9, 0.97) in distinguishing GDN from 
HP. Meanwhile, the diagnostic model2 based on the combination of β2-mG, PLT, and 
NEU in GDM and GDN patients was built using logistic regression, and the area 
under the ROC curve (AUC ROC) was 0.79 (0.73, 0.85), which was larger than the 
individual biomarker AUC.
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that the diagnostic model established by the 
combination of renal function indicators and blood cell indicators could 
facilitate the differential diagnosis of GDM and GDN patients.

Since 2009, the FDA Center for Tobacco Products (CTP) has had the authority to 
regulate the manufacturing, distribution, and marketing of tobacco products in 
order to reduce the death and disease caused by tobacco use. Biomarkers of 
exposure pertain to actual human exposure to chemicals arising from tobacco use 
and could play an important role across a number of FDA regulatory activities, 
including assessing new and modified-risk tobacco products and identifying and 
evaluating potential product standards. On August 3-4, 2015, FDA/CTP hosted a 
public workshop focused on biomarkers of exposure with participants from 
government, industry, academia, and other organizations. The workshop was 
divided into four sessions focused on: (i) approaches to evaluating and 
selecting biomarkers; (ii) biomarkers of exposure and relationship to disease 
risk; (iii) currently used biomarkers of exposure and biomarkers in development; 
and (iv) biomarkers of exposure and the assessment of smokeless tobacco and 
electronic nicotine delivery systems. This article synthesizes the main findings 
from the workshop and highlights research areas that could further strengthen 
the science around biomarkers of exposure and help determine their application 
in tobacco product regulation. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 26(3); 291-302.

INTRODUCTION: "Dual use" refers to the concurrent use of tobacco cigarettes 
(smoking) and electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes; vaping). Although dual use is 
common among e-cigarette users, there is little evidence regarding biomarkers of 
exposure among dual users and how these change under different conditions of 
product use.
METHODS: A nonblinded within-subjects crossover experiment was conducted with 
adult daily dual users (n = 48) in Ontario, Canada. Participants completed three 
consecutive 7-day periods in which the use of tobacco cigarettes and 
e-cigarettes was experimentally manipulated, resulting in four study conditions: 
Dual use, Tobacco cigarette use, E-cigarette use, and No product use. Repeated 
measures models were used to examine changes in product use and biomarkers of 
exposure.
RESULTS: Compared to dual use, cotinine remained stable when participants 
exclusively smoked (p = .524), but significantly decreased when they exclusively 
vaped (p = .027), despite significant increases in e-cigarette consumption (p = 
.001). Levels of biomarkers of exposure to toxicants, including carbon monoxide 
(CO), 1-hydroxypyrene (1-HOP), and 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol 
(NNAL), were significantly lower when participants exclusively vaped than when 
they engaged in dual use (CO = -41%, p < .001; 1-HOP = -31%, p = .025; NNAL = 
-30%, p = .017). Similar findings were observed among participants abstaining 
from both products as compared to dual use (CO: -26%, p < .001; 1-HOP = -14% 
[ns]; NNAL = -35%, p = .016). In contrast, levels of biomarkers of exposure 
increased when participants exclusively smoked as compared to dual use (CO = 
+21%, p = .029; 1-HOP = +23%, p = .048; NNAL = +8% [ns]).
CONCLUSIONS: Although dual use may reduce exposure to tobacco smoke constituents 
to some extent, abstaining from smoking is the most effective way to reduce such 
exposure.
IMPLICATIONS: Public health authorities should clearly communicate the relative 
risk of e-cigarettes and tobacco cigarettes to the general public, focusing on 
two salient points: (1) e-cigarettes are not harmless, but they are less harmful 
than tobacco cigarettes; and (2) using e-cigarettes while smoking may not 
necessarily reduce health risks; therefore, consumers should stop smoking 
completely to maximize potential health benefits.

Author information:

Switzerland. Electronic address: Jean-Francois.Etter@unige.ch.

BACKGROUND: It is not clear whether, in established vapers, cotinine levels 
remain stable or change over time.
METHODS: We enrolled 98 exclusive users of e-cigarettes on websites and forums 
dedicated to smoking cessation and to e-cigarettes. We collected saliva vials by 
mail in 2013-2014 (baseline), and collected a second saliva vial eight months 
later (follow-up) in the same participants. Participants had not used any 
tobacco or nicotine medications in the previous five days. Cotinine in saliva 
was analyzed with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Use of e-cigarettes, 
tobacco and nicotine medications was self-reported.
RESULTS: All participants were former smokers, and 99% were using e-cigarettes 
daily. They had already been using e-cigarettes for nine months on average at 
baseline. The median cotinine level was 252ng/mL at baseline (quartiles: 
124-421ng/mL) and 307ng/mL at follow-up (114-466ng/mL, W=0.9, p=0.4 for change 
over time). The median concentration of nicotine in refill liquids was 11mg/mL 
at baseline (quartiles: 6-15mg/mL) and 6mg/mL at follow-up (5-12mg/mL) (Wilcoxon 
signed rank test: W=5.2, p<0.001 for change over time). The median volume of 
e-liquid used per month was 80mL at baseline (quartiles: 50-130mL) and 100mL at 
follow-up (60-157mL, W=3.3, p=0.001 for change over time).
CONCLUSION: In experienced e-cigarette users enrolled online, cotinine levels 
were similar to levels usually observed in cigarette smokers. Over time, these 
users decreased the concentration of nicotine in their e-liquids, but increased 
their consumption of e-liquid in order to maintain their cotinine levels 
constant.

INTRODUCTION: Very little is known about the immediate physiological 
implications of vaping or inhaling second-hand vapor. This study used a 
quantitative approach to understand the short-term physiological implications of 
vape use and exposure to sec-ond-hand vapor for people who do not vape.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: One hundred and forty-eight people participated in the 
study, 75 self-identified as non-vapers and 73 self-identified as people who 
vape. All participants were over the age of 18. Participants used or were 
exposed to non-flavored e-juice without nicotine in Sorin® vape devices. Heart 
rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, blood oxygenation, blood glucose and 
pulmonary function tests were assessed. Physiological parameters were assessed 
prior to vape use or exposure to vapor and again after 20 minutes of vaping.
RESULTS: Findings indicated there were no significant changes in most health 
parameters except blood pressure which was reduced in both groups. Heart rate 
was also significantly reduced for vaping participants.
CONCLUSION: Vaping without flavorings or nicotine do not appear to have an 
immediate negative health impact on vital signs. The physiological effects of 
long-term exposure and/or vape use requires additional investigation. 
Information was established regarding the physiological effects of non-flavored, 
non-nicotine vaping so future studies can compare the effects of vaping with 
assorted flavors and nicotine concentrations to the effects of vaping only the 
base ingredients (vegetable glycerin and propylene glycol). New knowledge was 
gleaned relating to exposure to vapor, a phenomenon not previously examined but 
common espe-cially among non-vaping people who attend social events where people 
are vaping.

Vapors produced by electronic cigarettes and e-juices with flavorings induce 
toxicity, oxidative stress, and inflammatory response in lung epithelial cells 
and in mouse lung.

Oxidative stress and inflammatory response are the key events in the 
pathogenesis of chronic airway diseases. The consumption of electronic 
cigarettes (e-cigs) with a variety of e-liquids/e-juices is alarmingly 
increasing without the unrealized potential harmful health effects. We 
hypothesized that electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS)/e-cigs pose health 
concerns due to oxidative toxicity and inflammatory response in lung cells 
exposed to their aerosols. The aerosols produced by vaporizing ENDS e-liquids 
exhibit oxidant reactivity suggesting oxidants or reactive oxygen species 
(OX/ROS) may be inhaled directly into the lung during a "vaping" session. These 
OX/ROS are generated through activation of the heating element which is affected 
by heating element status (new versus used), and occurs during the process of 
e-liquid vaporization. Unvaporized e-liquids were oxidative in a manner 
dependent on flavor additives, while flavors containing sweet or fruit flavors 
were stronger oxidizers than tobacco flavors. In light of OX/ROS generated in 
ENDS e-liquids and aerosols, the effects of ENDS aerosols on tissues and cells 
of the lung were measured. Exposure of human airway epithelial cells (H292) in 
an air-liquid interface to ENDS aerosols from a popular device resulted in 
increased secretion of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and IL-8. 
Furthermore, human lung fibroblasts exhibited stress and morphological change in 
response to treatment with ENDS/e-liquids. These cells also secrete increased 
IL-8 in response to a cinnamon flavored e-liquid and are susceptible to loss of 
cell viability by ENDS e-liquids. Finally, exposure of wild type C57BL/6J mice 
to aerosols produced from a popular e-cig increase pro-inflammatory cytokines 
and diminished lung glutathione levels which are critical in maintaining 
cellular redox balance. Thus, exposure to e-cig aerosols/juices incurs 
measurable oxidative and inflammatory responses in lung cells and tissues that 
could lead to unrealized health consequences.

INTRODUCTION: Children with smoking parents are potentially exposed to 
Environmental Tobacco Smoke (ETS). The aims of this study were: 1) to assess ETS 
exposure in Milan schoolchildren, by measuring urinary cotinine (COT-U), 2) to 
compare the parents' perception of children ETS exposure, with the actual ETS 
exposure measured by COT-U, 3) to explore the factors influencing COT-U, 
including smoking bans at home, the season, and children characteristics.
METHODS: One-hundred school children (7-11 years) and their parents were 
recruited for the study in Spring 2018 (n = 81) and in Winter 2019 (n = 94), 75 
children participated to both campaigns, for a sum of 175 observations. A 
questionnaire was submitted to parents to collect information about smoking 
habits in the house. COT-U was measured by LC-MS/MS in spot urine sample 
collected in the morning from children.
RESULTS: Detectable COT-U levels were found in 42% and 57% of children, in 
spring and winter, in contrast with 17% and 13% of parents acknowledging ETS 
exposure. Children living with smokers or e-cigarette users (vapers) (30% of the 
participants) had higher COT-U levels than children not living with smokers or 
vapers (median 0.67, 0.46, and <0.1 μg/L in spring, and 0.98, 0.85, and 0.11 
μg/L in winter, respectively). Increasingly higher COT-U levels were observed in 
children living in homes where smoking was completely banned, allowed in the 
external parts of the home, or allowed in some rooms. The multiple regression 
analysis confirmed the positive significant effect of living with smokers, a 
partial smoking ban and absence of smoking ban at home, the winter season, and 
BMI as determinants of COT-U.
CONCLUSION: ETS exposure resulted in measurable urinary cotinine in children. 
Smoking parents underestimate exposure to ETS of their children. Living with 
smokers is a determinant of COT-U, only slightly mitigated by adopting partial 
smoking ban.

The objective of this clinical study was to investigate the pharmacokinetics of 
nicotine following the use of a prototype novel tobacco vapor (PNTV) product in 
comparison to a conventional cigarette (CC1). The study was conducted in 
Japanese healthy adult male smokers, using an open-label, randomized, two-period 
crossover design, to assess the pharmacokinetics of nicotine after controlled 
use of a PNTV product or CC1. During the study period, blood samples were drawn 
from subjects for the measurement of plasma nicotine concentrations and nicotine 
intake was estimated from the mouth level exposure (MLE). The Cmax and AUClast 
following the use of PNTV product were 45.7% and 68.3%, respectively, of those 
obtained with CC1 and there were no significant differences in the tmax and t1/2 
between PNTV product and CC1. The estimated MLE following the use of PNTV 
product was approximately two-thirds of that obtained following the smoking of 
CC1, but the relative bioavailability of PNTV product to CC1 was approximately 
104%. The differences in Cmax and AUClast between PNTV product and CC1 therefore 
are explained by differences in nicotine intake. These results suggest that the 
PNTV product shows a similar pharmacokinetic profile to CC1, while delivering 
less nicotine following controlled use.

Electronic cigarettes (ECs) are battery-operated devices designed to vaporise 
nicotine, which may help smokers with quitting or reducing their tobacco 
consumption. No data is available regarding the health effects of ECs use among 
smokers with arterial hypertension and whether regular use results in blood 
pressure (BP) changes. We investigated long-term changes in resting BP and level 
of BP control in hypertensive smokers who quit or reduced substantially their 
tobacco consumption by switching to ECs. A medical records review of patients 
with hypertension was conducted to identify patients reporting regular daily use 
of ECs on at least two consecutive follow-up visits. Regularly smoking 
hypertensive patients were included as a reference group. A marked reduction in 
cigarette consumption was observed in ECs users (n = 43) though consumption 
remained unchanged in the control group (n = 46). Compared to baseline, at 12 
months (follow-up visit 2) decline in cigarette consumption was associated with 
significant reductions in median (25th-, 75th-centile) systolic BP (140 (134.5, 
144) to 130 (123.5, 138.5) mmHg; p < 0.001) and diastolic BP (86 (78, 90) to 80 
(74.5, 90) mmHg; p = 0.006). No significant changes were observed in the control 
group. As expected, decline in cigarette consumption in the ECs users was also 
associated with improved BP control. The study concludes that regular ECs use 
may aid smokers with arterial hypertension reduce or abstain from cigarette 
smoking, with only trivial post-cessation weight gain. This resulted in 
improvements in systolic and diastolic BP as well as better BP control.

Changes in fifteen urine, blood and exhaled breath BoEs of HPHCs representing 
classes of compounds reported by FDA to be significant contributors to 
smoking-associated disease risks were measured in 105 clinical-confined subjects 
following randomization and a five-day forced-switch from usual brand 
conventional combustible cigarettes to: (i) exclusive commercial e-cigarette 
use; (ii) dual-use of commercial e-cigarettes and the subject's usual cigarette 
brand; or (iii) discontinued use of all tobacco or nicotine products. Levels of 
urinary biomarkers in subjects that completely substituted their usual cigarette 
with e-cigarettes were significantly lower (29-95%) after 5 days. Percent 
reductions in eight of nine urinary BoEs were indistinguishable to smokers who 
had quit smoking, except for nicotine equivalents, which declined by 25-40%. 
Dual users who halved self-reported daily cigarette consumption with 
e-cigarettes exhibited reductions (7-38%) in eight of nine urinary biomarkers, 
but had increase (1-20%) in nicotine equivalents. Reductions were broadly 
proportional to the reduced numbers of cigarettes smoked. Dual user urinary 
nicotine equivalents were slightly higher, but not statistically significant. 
After 5 days, blood nicotine biomarker levels were lower in the cessation 
(75-96%) and exclusive use groups (11-83%); with dual users experiencing no 
significant reductions. All subjects experienced significant decreases in 
exhaled CO. Decreases in the cessation and exclusive groups ranged from 88-89% 
and 27-32% in dual users. Exhaled NO increased in the cessation and exclusive 
groups (46-63% respectively), whereas the dual users experienced minimal 
changes. Overall, smokers who completely or partially substituted conventional 
cigarettes with e-cigarettes over five days, experienced reductions in HPHCs.

BACKGROUND: AB-FUBINACA and ADB-FUBINACA are structurally similar synthetic 
cannabinoids with potent CB1 receptor agonistic effects. Very little is known 
about their pharmacology and toxicology.
OBJECTIVE: To report a case of supraventricular tachycardia and acute confusion 
after ingestion of e-cigarette fluid containing AB-FUBINACA and ADB-FUBINACA, 
with quantitative analysis of the serum drug concentrations.
CASE REPORT: A healthy 24-year-old man ingested two drops of e-cigarette fluid 
which were later found to contain AB-FUBINACA and ADB-FUBINACA. Within 30 min of 
ingestion, he became somnolent, confused, and agitated, with palpitation and 
vomiting. On arrival to the emergency department, a short run of 
supraventricular tachycardia was noted, which resolved spontaneously. Bedside 
urine immunoassay failed to detect recreational drugs. Laboratory blood tests 
showed mild hypokalemia. Exposure to AB-FUBINACA and ADB-FUBINACA was confirmed 
analytically, with serum concentrations of 5.6 ng/mL and 15.6 ng/mL, 
respectively, in the blood sample collected on presentation. The patient 
recovered uneventfully with supportive treatment and was discharged 22 h after 
admission.
DISCUSSION: AB-FUBINACA and ADB-FUBINACA are orally bioavailable with rapid 
onset of toxicity after ingestion. In this case, supraventricular tachycardia 
was likely the result of exposure to AB-FUBINACA and ADB-FUBINACA. The serum 
concentrations of AB-FUBINACA and ADB-FUBINACA were higher than those previously 
reported in fatal cases.
CONCLUSION: In the context of acute poisoning, the presence of unexplained 
tachyarrhythmias, confusion, and a negative recreational drug screen should 
prompt clinicians to consider synthetic cannabinoid toxicity as a differential 
diagnosis.

BACKGROUND: Smoking reduction remains a pivotal issue in public health policy, 
but quit rates obtained with traditional quit-smoking therapies remain 
disappointingly low. Tobacco Harm Reduction (THR), aiming at less harmful ways 
of consuming nicotine, may provide a more effective alternative. One promising 
candidate for THR are electronic cigarettes (e-cigs). The aim of this study was 
to investigate the efficacy of second-generation e-cigs both in terms of acute 
craving-reduction in the lab and in terms of smoking reduction and experienced 
benefits/complaints in an eight-month Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT).
DESIGN: RCT with three arms.
METHODS: Participants (N = 48) unwilling to quit smoking were randomized into 
two e-cig groups and one control group. During three lab sessions (over two 
months) participants, who had been abstinent for four hours, vaped/smoked for 
five minutes, after which we monitored the effect on craving and withdrawal 
symptoms. eCO and saliva cotinine levels were also measured. In between lab 
sessions, participants in the e-cig groups could use e-cigs or smoke ad libitum, 
whereas the control group could only smoke. After the lab sessions, the control 
group also received an e-cig. The RCT included several questionnaires, which 
repeatedly monitored the effect of ad libitum e-cig use on the use of tobacco 
cigarettes and the experienced benefits/complaints up to six months after the 
last lab session.
RESULTS: From the first lab session on, e-cig use after four hours of abstinence 
resulted in a reduction in cigarette craving which was of the same magnitude as 
when a cigarette was smoked, while eCO was unaffected. After two months, we 
observed that 34% of the e-cig groups had stopped smoking tobacco cigarettes, 
versus 0% of the control group. After five months, the e-cig groups demonstrated 
a total quit-rate of 37%, whereas the control group showed a quit rate of 38% 
three months after initiating e-cig use. At the end of the eight-month study, 
19% of the e-cig groups and 25% of the control group were totally abstinent from 
smoking, while an overall reduction of 60% in the number of cigarettes smoked 
per day was observed (compared to intake). eCO levels decreased, whereas 
cotinine levels were the same in all groups at each moment of measurement. 
Reported benefits far outweighed the reported complaints.
CONCLUSION: In a series of controlled lab sessions with e-cig naïve tobacco 
smokers, second generation e-cigs were shown to be immediately and highly 
effective in reducing abstinence induced cigarette craving and withdrawal 
symptoms, while not resulting in increases in eCO. Remarkable (>50 pc) 
eight-month reductions in, or complete abstinence from tobacco smoking was 
achieved with the e-cig in almost half (44%) of the participants.

BACKGROUND: Cigarette smoking is associated with an increase in cardiovascular 
disease risk, attributable in part to reactive volatile organic chemicals 
(VOCs). However, little is known about the extent of VOC exposure due to the use 
of other tobacco products.
METHODS: We recruited 48 healthy, tobacco users in four groups: cigarette, 
smokeless tobacco, occasional users of first generation e-cigarette and 
e-cigarette menthol and 12 healthy nontobacco users. After abstaining for 48 h, 
tobacco users used an assigned product. Urine was collected at baseline followed 
by five collections over a 3-h period to measure urinary metabolites of VOCs, 
nicotine, and tobacco alkaloids.
RESULTS: Urinary levels of nicotine were ≃2-fold lower in occasional e-cigarette 
and smokeless tobacco users than in the cigarette smokers; cotinine and 
3-hydroxycotinine levels were similar in all groups. Compared with nontobacco 
users, e-cigarette users had higher levels of urinary metabolites of xylene, 
cyanide, styrene, ethylbenzene, and benzene at baseline and elevated urinary 
levels of metabolites of xylene, N,N-dimethylformamide, and acrylonitrile after 
e-cigarette use. Metabolites of acrolein, crotonaldehyde, and 1,3-butadiene were 
significantly higher in smokers than in users of other products or nontobacco 
users. VOC metabolite levels in smokeless tobacco group were comparable to those 
found in nonusers with the exception of xylene metabolite-2-methylhippuric acid 
(2MHA), which was almost three fold higher than in nontobacco users.
CONCLUSIONS: Smoking results in exposure to a range of VOCs at concentrations 
higher than those observed with other products, and first generation e-cigarette 
use is associated with elevated levels of N,N-dimethylformamide and xylene 
metabolites.
IMPLICATIONS: This study shows that occasional users of first generation 
e-cigarettes have lower levels of nicotine exposure than the users of 
combustible cigarettes. Compared with combustible cigarettes, e-cigarettes, and 
smokeless tobacco products deliver lower levels of most VOCs, with the exception 
of xylene, N,N-dimethylformamide, and acrylonitrile, whose metabolite levels 
were higher in the urine of e-cigarette users than nontobacco users. Absence of 
anatabine in the urine of e-cigarette users suggests that measuring urinary 
levels of this alkaloid may be useful in distinguishing between users of 
e-cigarettes and combustible cigarettes. However, these results have to be 
validated in a larger cohortcomprised of users of e-cigarettes of multiple 
brands.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Adolescents are regularly exposed to ∆9 
-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) via smoking and, more recently, vaping cannabis 
extracts. Growing legalization of cannabis for medical and recreational 
purposes, combined with decreasing perceptions of harm, makes it increasingly 
important to determine the consequences of frequent adolescent exposure for 
motivated behaviour and lasting tolerance in response to THC.
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACHES: Male and female rats inhaled THC vapour, or that from 
the propylene glycol (PG) vehicle, twice daily for 30 min from postnatal day 
(PND) 35-39 and PND 42-46 using an e-cigarette system. Thermoregulatory 
responses to vapour inhalation were assessed by radio-telemetry during 
adolescence and from PND 86-94. Chow intake was assessed in adulthood. Blood 
samples were obtained from additional adolescent groups following initial THC 
inhalation and after 4 days of twice daily exposure. Additional groups exposed 
repeatedly to THC or PG during adolescence were evaluated for intravenous 
self-administration of oxycodone as adults.
KEY RESULTS: Female, not male, adolescents developed tolerance to the 
hypothermic effects of THC inhalation in the first week of repeated exposure 
despite similar plasma THC levels. Each sex exhibited tolerance to THC 
hypothermia in adulthood after repeated adolescent THC. However, enhanced 
potency was found in females. Repeated THC male rats consumed more food than 
their PG-treated control group, without significant bodyweight differences. 
Adolescent THC did not alter oxycodone self-administration in either sex but 
increased fentanyl self-administration in females.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Repeated THC vapour inhalation in adolescent rats 
has lasting consequences observable in adulthood.

INTRODUCTION: The single-dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of a novel, 
non-tobacco-based nicotine pouch, ZYN, 3 and 6 mg, were compared with 8 mg 
General snus (part 1) and ZYN 8 mg was compared with 18 mg Longhorn moist snuff 
(part 2). The present study demonstrates the characteristics of three strengths 
of a novel tobacco-free oral snus, ZYN, viz. the extraction of nicotine from the 
oral cavity and its uptake into the systemic blood circulation. Comparison is 
made to Swedish General snus and American Longhorn moist snuff and from 
literature 4 mg Nicorette gum and mean of 13 brands of e-cigarettes.
AIMS AND METHODS: A single-dose randomized crossover design was used. In vivo 
extraction and PK parameters were determined.
RESULTS: Part 1. The AUCinf of ZYN 3 mg was 27% smaller than that of 8 mg 
General and the AUCinf of ZYN 6 mg was 34% larger than that of 8 mg General. 
Less nicotine was extracted from ZYN 3 mg (1.5 mg) and more from ZYN 6 mg (3.5 
mg) than from 8 mg General (2.4 mg). The extracted fractions of nicotine for 
both ZYN products (56% and 59%) were significantly larger than for 8 mg General 
(32%).
RESULTS: Part 2. Close to identical plasma nicotine curves, AUCinf and Cmax were 
found for ZYN 8 mg and Longhorn Natural 18 mg moist snuff. The extracted amount 
of nicotine from ZYN 8 mg (3.8 mg) was larger than the amount extracted from 
Longhorn Natural 18 mg (3.0 mg), but smaller than the extracted amount of 
nicotine from General 2 × 8 mg snus pouches (5.0 mg). The extracted fraction of 
nicotine for ZYN 8 mg (50%) was larger than for Longhorn Natural (19%) and 
General 2 × 8 mg snus pouches (33%).
CONCLUSIONS: The two higher doses of ZYN (6 and 8 mg) deliver nicotine as 
quickly and to a similar extent as existing smokeless products, with no 
significant adverse effects.

INTRODUCTION: This study examined changes in biomarkers of exposure (BoE) after 
5 days of nicotine-salt pod system (NSPS) use, compared with continuation of 
usual-cigarette smoking and cigarette abstinence, among adult combustible 
cigarette smokers.
AIMS AND METHODS: A randomized, open-label, parallel-cohort, confinement study 
of healthy adult smokers, naive to NSPS use, was conducted. Participants (N = 
90) were randomized to six cohorts (n = 15 each): exclusive ad libitum use of 
NSPS (four flavors: Virginia Tobacco, Mint, Mango, Creme), continuation of 
usual-brand cigarette smoking, or cigarette abstinence. Total nicotine 
equivalents and BoE (NNN, NNAL, 3-HPMA, MHBMA, S-PMA, HMPMA, CEMA, 1-OHP, and 
COHb) were measured.
RESULTS: Eight non-nicotine BoEs, measured in urine, were reduced by an 
aggregate of 85.0% in the pooled NSPS cohort; increased by 14.4% in the 
cigarette cohort (p < .001 for pooled NSPS vs. cigarette); and reduced by 85.3% 
in the abstinence cohort (p > .05; 99.6% relative reduction between pooled NSPS 
vs. abstinence). Similar changes in individual BoEs were also observed (p < .001 
for each BoE between pooled NSPS vs. cigarettes; and abstinence vs. pooled NSPS; 
p > .05 for each BoE between pooled NSPS vs. abstinence). Blood COHb decreased 
by 71.8% in the pooled NSPS cohort and 69.1% in the abstinence cohort (p > .05) 
and increased by 13.3% in the cigarette cohort (p < .001). Mean total urine 
nicotine equivalents increased in the pooled NSPS and cigarette cohorts by 9% 
and 26%, respectively, and did not significantly differ (p > .05).
CONCLUSION: Complete switching from cigarettes to NSPS produced significant 
reductions in key non-nicotine BoEs associated with cigarette smoking.
IMPLICATIONS: The results of this study concorded with evidence that complete 
switching from combustible cigarettes to tobacco and nontobacco-flavored vapor 
products may reduce exposure to key carcinogens and other toxicants known to be 
associated with tobacco-related diseases. Future research is needed to assess 
the long-term health effects of NSPS use. These results should not be 
interpreted to mean that the use of NSPS is without any risk, particularly for 
nonusers of tobacco products.

While much is known about the effect of smoke and vapors on the composition of 
blood, little is known about their impact on the composition of breath. When 
tobacco from traditional cigarettes (T) is burned, it produces harmful smoke 
compared with the vapor produced when using electronic cigarettes (E). Using a 
noninvasive, safe, and rapid CO2 laser-photoacoustic method, this study aimed to 
examine the ethylene changes at different time intervals in the exhaled breath 
composition of E-cigarette smokers and T-cigarette smokers, before and after the 
consecutive exposures to cigarettes. Oxidative stress from exposure to tobacco 
smoke has a role in the pathogenic process, leading to chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease. The evidence on the mechanisms by which T-smoking causes 
damage indicates that there is no risk-free level of exposure to tobacco smoke. 
The study revealed that the ethylene level (in the E-cigarette smoker's case) 
was found to be in smaller concentrations (compared with T-cigarette smoker's 
case) and that E-cigarettes may provide an alternative to T-cigarette smoking.

The use of flavoring substances is an important element in the development of 
reduced-risk products for adult smokers to increase product acceptance and 
encourage switching from cigarettes. In a first step towards characterizing the 
sub-chronic inhalation toxicity of neat flavoring substances, a study was 
conducted using a mixture of the substances in a base solution of e-liquid, 
where the standard toxicological endpoints of the nebulized aerosols were 
supplemented with transcriptomics analysis. The flavor mixture was produced by 
grouping 178 flavors into 26 distinct chemical groups based on structural 
similarities and potential metabolic and biological effects. Flavoring 
substances predicted to show the highest toxicological effect from each group 
were selected as the flavor group representatives (FGR). Following Organization 
for Economic Cooperation and Development Testing Guideline 413, rats were 
exposed to three concentrations of the FGR mixture in an e-liquid composed of 
nicotine (23 µg/L), propylene glycol (1520 µg/L), and vegetable glycerin 
(1890 µg/L), while non-flavored and no-nicotine mixtures were included as 
references to identify potential additive or synergistic effects between 
nicotine and the flavoring substances. The results indicated that the inhalation 
of an e-liquid containing the mixture of FGRs caused very minimal local and 
systemic toxic effects. In particular, there were no remarkable clinical 
(in-life) observations in flavored e-liquid-exposed rats. The biological effects 
related to exposure to the mixture of neat FGRs were limited and mainly 
nicotine-mediated, including changes in hematological and blood chemistry 
parameters and organ weight. These results indicate no significant additive 
biological changes following inhalation exposure to the nebulized FGR mixture 
above the nicotine effects measured in this sub-chronic inhalation study. In a 
subsequent study, e-liquids with FGR mixtures will be aerosolized by thermal 
treatment and assessed for toxicity.

IMPORTANCE: Vaporization is an increasingly popular method for cannabis 
administration, and policy changes have increased adult access to cannabis 
drastically. Controlled examinations of cannabis vaporization among adults with 
infrequent current cannabis use patterns (>30 days since last use) are needed.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the acute dose effects of smoked and vaporized cannabis 
using controlled administration methods.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This within-participant, double-blind, 
crossover study was conducted from June 2016 to January 2017 at the Behavioral 
Pharmacology Research Unit, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, and 
included 17 healthy adults. Six smoked and vaporized outpatient experimental 
sessions (1-week washout between sessions) were completed in clusters (order 
counterbalanced across participants); dose order was randomized within each 
cluster.
INTERVENTIONS: Cannabis containing Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) doses of 0 mg, 
10 mg, and 25 mg was vaporized and smoked by each participant.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Change from baseline scores for subjective drug 
effects, cognitive and psychomotor performance, vital signs, and blood THC 
concentration.
RESULTS: The sample included 17 healthy adults (mean [SD] age, 27.3 [5.7] years; 
9 men and 8 women) with no cannabis use in the prior month (mean [SD] days since 
last cannabis use, 398 [437] days). Inhalation of cannabis containing 10 mg of 
THC produced discriminative drug effects (mean [SD] ratings on a 100-point 
visual analog scale, smoked: 46 [26]; vaporized: 69 [26]) and modest impairment 
of cognitive functioning. The 25-mg dose produced significant drug effects (mean 
[SD] ratings, smoked: 66 [29]; vaporized: 78 [24]), increased incidence of 
adverse effects, and pronounced impairment of cognitive and psychomotor ability 
(eg, significant decreased task performance compared with placebo in vaporized 
conditions). Vaporized cannabis resulted in qualitatively stronger drug effects 
for most pharmacodynamic outcomes and higher peak concentrations of THC in 
blood, compared with equal doses of smoked cannabis (25-mg dose: smoked, 10.2 
ng/mL; vaporized, 14.4 ng/mL). Blood THC concentrations and heart rate peaked 
within 30 minutes after cannabis administration and returned to baseline within 
3 to 4 hours. Several subjective drug effects and observed cognitive and 
psychomotor impairments persisted for up to 6 hours on average.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Vaporized and smoked cannabis produced dose-orderly 
drug effects, which were stronger when vaporized. These data can inform 
regulatory and clinical decisions surrounding the use of cannabis among adults 
with little or no prior cannabis exposure.

BACKGROUND Smoking nicotine is considered to be one of the most harmful 
addictions, leading to the development of a number of health complications, 
including many pathologies in the oral cavity. The aim of this study was to 
examine the effect of smoking traditional cigarettes, e-cigarettes, and 
heat-not-burn products on profiles of salivary lipids and lipid peroxidation 
products in the unstimulated and stimulated saliva of healthy young adults with 
a smoking habit of up to 3 years. MATERIAL AND METHODS We enrolled 3 groups of 
25 smoking patients each and a control group matched for age, gender, and oral 
status. In saliva collected from patients from the study groups and participants 
from the control group, the concentrations of sphingolipids: sphingosine, 
sphinganine, sphingosine-1-phosphate, ceramides, and salivary lipid peroxidation 
products - malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) - were measured. The 
normality of distribution was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test. For 
comparison of the results, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by post 
hoc Tukey test was used. RESULTS We demonstrated that each type of smoking 
causes a decrease in the concentration of salivary lipids, and there was an 
increased concentration of salivary MDA and 4-HNE. CONCLUSIONS Smoking in the 
initial period of addiction leads to an increase in the concentration of lipid 
peroxidation products through increased oxidative stress, leading to disturbance 
of the lipid balance of the oral cavity (eg, due to damage to cell membranes).

BACKGROUND: Non-cigarette other tobacco products (OTP; e.g., cigarillos, little 
cigars) are typically used in combination with cigarettes, but limited data 
exists on the tobacco toxicant exposure profiles of dual cigarette-OTP (Cig-OTP) 
users. This study examined biomarkers of nicotine and carcinogen exposure in 
cigarette smokers who used or did not use OTP.
METHODS: 111 Cig-OTP and 111 cigarette only (Cig Only) users who smoked 
equivalent cigarettes per day were matched on age (< 40, >=40), race (African 
American, White), and gender. Participants reported past 7-day daily use of 
cigarettes and OTP and provided urine for nicotine, cotinine, total nicotine 
equivalents (TNE) and total NNAL concentrations.
RESULTS: Cig-OTP users reported greater past 7-day tobacco use (15.9 versus 13.0 
products/day, p<0.01) but had significantly lower creatinine-normalized nicotine 
(606 versus 1301ng/mg), cotinine (1063 versus 2125ng/mg), TNE (28 versus 57 
nmol/mg) and NNAL (251 versus 343pg/mg) than Cig Only users (p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Cig-OTP users had lower levels of nicotine and metabolites of a 
lung carcinogen relative to Cig-Only users, but concentrations of toxicants 
among Cig-OTP users were still at levels that place smokers at great risk from 
the detrimental health effects of smoking.
IMPACT: Our study finds that nicotine and carcinogen exposure in Cig-OTP users 
are lower compared to cigarette only users, but still likely to be associated 
with substantial harm. A better understanding of why toxicant levels may be 
lower in Cig-OTP is an important area for future study.

IMPORTANCE: Fourth-generation nicotine salt pod system (NSPS) electronic 
cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are the leading class of e-cigarettes. They contain 
high nicotine concentrations, which may facilitate switching among smokers, but 
could also lead to increased exposure to nicotine and biomarkers of potential 
harm. African American and Latinx smokers experience significant tobacco-related 
health disparities. The potential of NSPS e-cigarettes to reduce smoking-related 
harm among these groups is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the harm reduction potential of NSPS e-cigarette vs 
combustible cigarettes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This unblinded randomized clinical trial 
compared 6 weeks of e-cigarette use vs cigarettes as usual from to 2018 to 2019 
among smokers in the San Diego, California, and Kansas City, Missouri, areas. 
Participants included African American and Latinx adult combustible cigarette 
smokers who smoked at least 5 cigarettes/d on at least 25 of the past 30 days 
for at least 6 months and were interested in switching to e-cigarettes. Data 
were analyzed from September 18, 2019, to September 4, 2020.
INTERVENTIONS: 6 weeks of e-cigarette use in a choice of pod flavors (5% 
nicotine) along with brief education, training, and action planning to 
completely switch to e-cigarettes from combustible cigarettes. The control group 
smoked combustible cigarettes as usual.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was reduction in urinary 
4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL) concentration at week 6. 
Secondary outcomes were change in urinary cotinine, expired carbon monoxide 
(CO), respiratory symptoms, lung function, blood pressure, past 7-day 
consumption of combustible cigarettes, and switching rates (e-cigarette group 
only) at weeks 2 and 6.
RESULTS: This study included 186 participants, including 92 African American 
participants and 94 Latinx participants. The mean (SD) age was 43.3 (12.5) 
years, and 75 (40.3%) were women. Participants smoked a mean (SD) of 12.1 (7.2) 
cigarettes/d on 6.8 (0.6) d/wk at baseline. A total of 125 participants were 
randomized to the e-cigarette group and 61 were randomized to the control group. 
At baseline, median (interquartile range) NNAL was 124 (45-197) pg/mL in the 
e-cigarette group and 88 (58-197) pg/mL in the control group. At week 6, the 
e-cigarette group had significantly greater reductions in NNAL (relative risk 
[RR], 0.36 [95% CI, 0.23-0.54]; P < .001), CO (RR, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.42-0.68]; 
P < .001), respiratory symptoms (RR, 0.63 [95% CI, 0.47-0.85]; P = .002), and 
number of cigarettes smoked in the past 7 days among those still smoking (RR, 
0.30 [95% CI, 0.20-0.43]; P < .001) than the control group and maintained their 
cotinine levels (RR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.58-1.10]; P = .17). Lung function and 
diastolic and systolic blood pressure remained unchanged and did not differ 
between groups. For participants randomized to receive e-cigarettes, 32 
participants (28.1%) were exclusively using e-cigarettes at week 6, while 66 
participants (57.9%) were dual using and 16 participants (14%) resumed 
exclusively using cigarettes.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that e-cigarettes may be an 
inclusive harm reduction strategy for African American and Latinx smokers.

Military Medical University, Chongqing, China.

To develop a new prostate cancer predictor (PCP) model using the combination of 
total prostate-specific antigen (tPSA), free PSA (fPSA), and complexed PSA 
(cPSA).The diagnoses of all the included patients were confirmed pathologically 
in Daping Hospital between December 1, 2011 and December 1, 2014. There were 54 
PCa cases and 579 benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) cases with tPSA levels of 2 
to 10 ng/mL, and 48 PCa cases and 147 BPH cases with tPSA levels of 10 to 
20 ng/mL. Logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) 
analyses were employed to compare the value of PCP (PCP = tPSA / fPSA × √cPSA) 
with tPSA, fPSA, the ratio of fPSA to tPSA (%fPSA), and cPSA for the 
differential diagnosis of PCa and BPH. Meanwhile, bootstrapping analysis was 
used to calculate the distribution and confidence intervals (CIs) for the area 
under the curve (AUC), and Hosmer-Lemeshow tests were used to calculate P 
values.When tPSA levels were 2 to 10 ng/mL, the AUC of PCP (0.680) was 
significantly higher than that of tPSA (0.588), fPSA (0.571), %fPSA (0.675), and 
cPSA (0.613). When the sensitivity for the diagnosis of PCa was 90.7%, the 
specificity of PCP (22.8%) was higher than that of tPSA (11.1%), fPSA (11.2%), 
%fPSA (17.4%), and cPSA (15.5%). When tPSA levels were 10 to 20 ng/mL, the AUC 
of PCP (0.686) was significantly higher than that of tPSA (0.603), fPSA (0.643), 
%fPSA (0.679), and cPSA (0.647). When the sensitivity for the diagnosis of PCa 
was 91.7%, the specificity of PCP (29.3%) was higher than that of tPSA (10.9%), 
fPSA (10.2%), %fPSA (23.1%), and cPSA (18.4%).PCP is a novel model for the 
prediction of PCa; it has more predictive value than tPSA, fPSA, %fPSA, and cPSA 
when tPSA levels are 2 to 20 ng/mL.

Biomarkers of Smoking - Which Cut-Off Values Should be Used? Abstract. 
Verification of smoking status by means of biomarkers is important for treatment 
decisions of patients with smoking-related diseases. Cotinine is currently the 
best biomarker to document nicotine consumption. A low cost alternative method 
to determine smoking status is by measurement of carboxyhemoglobin (CO-Hb) in 
the exhaled breath. The main disadvantage of CO-Hb is the short half-life. The 
appropriate cut-off value for active nicotine consumption in Switzerland is 50 
ng/ml or higher cotinine in the urine or 10 ng/ml and 12 ng/ml in serum and 
saliva, respectively. CO-Hb levels greater than 2 % indicate smoking with high 
probability, levels above 3 % with very high probability.

Publisher: Zusammenfassung. Die Überprüfung des Raucherstatus mittels Biomarkern 
ist wichtig für Behandlungsentscheidungen von Patienten mit rauchbedingten 
Erkrankungen. Cotinin ist derzeit der beste Biomarker zur Dokumentation des 
Nikotinkonsums. Eine kostengünstige Alternative zur Bestimmung des Raucherstatus 
ist die Messung von Carboxyhämoglobin (CO-Hb) in der Ausatmungsluft. Der 
Hauptnachteil von CO-Hb ist die kurze Halbwertszeit. Der entsprechende Grenzwert 
für den aktiven Nikotinkonsum in der Schweiz liegt bei 50 ng/ml oder mehr 
Cotinin im Urin bzw. 10 ng/ml und 12 ng/ml im Serum und Speichel. CO-Hb-Werte 
von mehr als 2 % deuten mit hoher Wahrscheinlichkeit auf aktives Rauchen hin, 
Werte über 3 % mit sehr hoher Wahrscheinlichkeit.

Evaluating the safety of e-cigarettes and making informed judgement about 
developing potential standards require sufficient scientific evidence. Since 
e-cigarettes are highly engineered products containing plastic, glass and metal 
parts, and e-liquids are largely different matrices, many toxic compounds which 
are not typical hazards for the users of combustible tobacco products (e.g., 
cigarettes), could exist in e-liquids, and consequently, posing potential health 
risk to e-cigarette users. We combined the measurements of urinary metabolites 
of organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) with questionnaire data collected in 
the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) from 2013 to 
2014, and we compared adjusted geometric means (GM) for each biomarker in 
e-cigarette users with levels in non-users and users of various tobacco products 
using multiple regression analyses to adjust for potential confounders. We found 
diphenyl phosphate (DPhP), bis(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (BDCPP), 
bis(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (BCEP), and dibutyl phosphate (DBUP) were detected 
in all e-cigarette users. The adjusted GM of BCEP, the metabolite of 
tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP), was 81% higher than nonusers (p = 0.0124) 
and significantly higher than those for both cigarette and cigar users (p < 
0.05). The findings in this pilot study suggest that certain OPFRs may present 
in e-cigarettes as contaminants, and consequently, resulting in higher exposure 
levels in e-cigarette users compared to nonusers. As we only identified 14 
e-cigarette users in the survey, the findings in this study need to be confirmed 
in future study at a larger scale. A better examination of the types and levels 
of FRs and their potential contamination sources in e-cigarettes is also needed.

Tobacco use delivers nicotine, tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs), volatile 
organic compounds (VOCs), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are 
metabolized and excreted in urine offering useful biomarkers of exposure. 
Previous studies compared individual toxicants across tobacco users. Based on a 
group of biomarkers, cluster analysis was used to define tobacco toxicant 
exposure profiles. Clusters with distinct exposure profiles, were determined and 
described, based on levels of urinary biomarkers of exposure to nicotine, TSNAs, 
VOCs, and PAHs among a national sample of current, established, adult tobacco 
users, and examine the association of use behavior and cluster membership. The 
PATH Biomarker Wave 1 data were analyzed. Current established tobacco users with 
complete urinary biomarker data were included (N = 6724). User groups included 
cigarette smokers, users of electronic cigarette (ECIG), smokeless tobacco 
(SLT), and dual and poly tobacco users. Cluster analysis, pairwise comparisons, 
and multinomial logistic regression were conducted. Cigarette smokers were 
primarily in clusters with high biomarker concentrations across all groups, but 
actual concentrations were associated with smoking quantity. A cluster with high 
TSNAs but low levels of PAHs and VOCs was heavily populated by SLT users. 
Exclusive ECIG users, depending on use frequency, were predominantly in clusters 
with low biomarker concentrations, except for one cluster that had relatively 
high TSNAs. Clusters heavily populated by dual and poly tobacco users were the 
same as those heavily populated by cigarette smokers. Ten exposure profiles 
(clusters) were determined and linked to tobacco use behavior. Findings could 
inform future research and policy initiatives.

Purpose: Depression, which affects about 52% of Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
patients, can worsen cognitive impairment and increase mortality and suicide 
rates. We hope to provide clinical evidence for the prevention and treatment of 
depression in AD patients by investigating related risk factors of depression in 
AD patients.Methods: 158 AD inpatients of the Department of Neurology, Daping 
Hospital from September 2017 to March 2019 were enrolled. General information, 
laboratory tests, cognitive and emotional function assessments of the inpatients 
were collected. Logistic regression was used to analyze the risk factors of 
depression in AD patients, and the relationship between 17 Hamilton depression 
scale scores and HbA1c levels in AD patients was further analyzed.Results: The 
prevalence of age, gender, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, Type 2 diabetes 
mellitus (T2DM), and white matter lesions (WML) in the AD with depression group 
was significantly different from without depression group. Hypertension, T2DM, 
and WML are independent risk factors for depression in AD patients. The 
depression scores of AD patients with HbA1c>6.5% were significantly higher than 
AD patients with HbA1c ≤ 6.5%, and there were significant difference in 
depression scale scores between using anti-diabetes drugs group and not using 
anti-diabetes drugs group whose HbA1c level is >6.5%, while no difference in 
depression scores between using anti-diabetes drugs group and not using 
anti-diabetes drugs group whose HbA1c level is ≤6.5%.Conclusion: T2DM is an 
independent risk factor for AD patients with depression. Increased HbA1c levels 
aggravate depression in AD patients, and controlling HbA1c levels and 
anti-diabetes drugs can reduce the severity of depression in AD patients.

Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are ubiquitous in the environment. In the 
United States (U.S.), tobacco smoke is the major non-occupational source of 
exposure to many harmful VOCs. Exposure to VOCs can be assessed by measuring 
their urinary metabolites (VOCMs). The Population Assessment of Tobacco and 
Health (PATH) Study is a U.S. national longitudinal study of tobacco use in the 
adult and youth civilian non-institutionalized population. We measured 20 VOCMs 
in urine specimens from a subsample of adults in Wave 1 (W1) (2013-2014) to 
characterize VOC exposures among tobacco product users and non-users. We 
calculated weighted geometric means (GMs) and percentiles of each VOCM for 
exclusive combustible product users (smokers), exclusive electronic cigarette 
(e-cigarette) users, exclusive smokeless product users, and tobacco product 
never users. We produced linear regression models for six VOCMs with sex, age, 
race, and tobacco user group as predictor variables. Creatinine-ratioed levels 
of VOCMs from exposure to acrolein, crotonaldehyde, isoprene, acrylonitrile, and 
1,3-butadiene were significantly higher in smokers than in never users. Small 
differences of VOCM levels among exclusive e-cigarette users and smokeless users 
were observed when compared to never users. Smokers showed higher VOCM 
concentrations than e-cigarette, smokeless, and never users. Urinary VOC 
metabolites are useful biomarkers of exposure to harmful VOCs.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the levels of a tobacco-specific nitrosamine (NNAL) in 
non-smokers passively exposed to the second-hand aerosol (SHA) emitted from 
users of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes).
METHOD: We conducted an observational study involving 55 non-smoking volunteers 
divided into three groups: 25 living at home with conventional smokers, 6 living 
with e-cigarette users, and 24 in control homes (smoke-free homes). We obtained 
urine samples from all volunteers to determine NNAL.
RESULTS: We detected NNAL in the urine of volunteers exposed to e-cigarettes 
(median:0.55 pg/mL; interquartile range: 0.26-2.94 pg/mL). The percentage of 
urine samples with quantifiable NNAL differed significantly among the three 
groups of homes: 29.2%, 66.7% and 76.0%, respectively (p=0.004).
CONCLUSIONS: We found NNAL nitrosamine in urine samples from people exposed to 
SHA from e-cigarettes. However, these results could be confirmed with more 
studies with larger sample sizes.

The objectives of this clinical study were to demonstrate a reduction in 
exposure to selected harmful and potentially harmful constituents (HPHCs) in 
Japanese healthy adult smokers who switched to four in-market heated tobacco 
products. Eighty-nine smokers were randomly assigned for five days to one of six 
study groups: four groups who switched to one of the commercially available 
heated tobacco products; a group who continued to smoke their own brand of 
combustible cigarettes (CC); or a group who stopped smoking (SS). Fifteen 
biomarkers of exposure (BoE) to 14 HPHCs and pyrene were measured at baseline, 
Day 3 and Day 5 in 24 h urine and breath, under clinical confinement. Product 
consumption, nicotine uptake and subjective effects were also measured before 
and after product switching. On Day 5, significant reductions in most BoE 
relative to the CC group were observed after switching to heated tobacco 
products. No changes in BoE were observed between baseline and Day 5 in the CC 
group. Significantly, the magnitude of the reduction in exposure to most of the 
selected HPHCs observed in the heated tobacco product groups was close to that 
observed in the SS group.

Urinary mercapturic acids (MAs) are detoxification products for electrophiles 
occurring in the human body. They are suitable biomarkers of exposure to 
directly acting electrophilic chemicals or to chemicals which generate the 
electrophile during its metabolism. We determined the urinary excretion of 19 
MAs in habitual users of combustible cigarettes (CCs), electronic cigarettes 
(ECs), heated tobacco products (HTPs), oral tobacco (OT), and nicotine 
replacement therapy (NRT) products, and nonusers (NUs) of any tobacco/nicotine 
products. The 19 MAs are assumed to be physiologically formed primarily from 15 
toxicants with three of them belonging to IARC Group 1 (human carcinogen), seven 
to Group 2A (probable human carcinogen), four to Group 2B (possible human 
carcinogen), and one to Group 3 (not classifiable as carcinogen). Smoking (CC) 
was found to be associated with significantly elevated exposure to ethylene 
oxide (or ethylene), 1,3-butadiene, benzene, dimethylformamide, acrolein, 
acrylamide, styrene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, crotonaldehyde, and 
isoprene compared with the other user groups and NU. Users of HTPs revealed 
slight elevation in the MAs related to acrolein, acrylamide, and crotonaldehyde 
compared with the other non-CC groups. Vaping (EC) was not found to be 
associated with any of the MAs studied. In conclusion, the determination of 
urinary MAs is a useful tool for assessing the exposure to toxicants (mainly 
potential carcinogens) in users of various tobacco/nicotine products. Our data 
also give cause to clarify the role of vaping (EC) in urinary excretion of DHPMA 
(precursor: glycidol).

The class of novel psychoactive substances known as synthetic cannabinoids (SC) 
includes illicit compounds that are sprayed on plant material and smoked or sold 
as liquids to be vaporized in e-cigarettes. In toxicological analysis of SC, 
fast analytical methods are needed for the detection and confirmation of parent 
drugs and metabolites at very low levels. While various analytical methods have 
been developed for SC in blood and urine, few are available for alternative 
matrices such as oral fluid (OF). There are numerous advantages to using OF as a 
sample matrix for SC analysis, including non-invasive collection, lesser risk of 
adulteration, and presence of both parent drug and metabolites. Here we report a 
validated online solid-phase extraction (online SPE) method coupled to LC-QqQ-MS 
for rapid confirmation and quantitation of 72 structurally diverse SC parent 
drugs and metabolites in OF with 2.5 min of preconcentration time and a total 
elution time of < 10 min. The use of online SPE for sample pretreatment 
facilitates rapid and consistent processing and greatly increases sample 
throughput. The method was fully validated according to relevant guidelines 
(ANSI/ASB Standard 036). Bias and precision values were within ± 20% for all 
compounds in human OF matrix. Method detection and quantitation limits ranged 
from 0.4 to 3.8 ng/mL and from 1.1 to 11.6 ng/mL, respectively. Recovery, matrix 
effects, process efficiency, carryover, and stability were also within 
acceptable limits for the majority of compounds. Successful application of the 
method was demonstrated using blank human OF fortified with SC in addition to a 
set of authentic OF specimens previously tested by another laboratory. Graphical

PURPOSE: Smoking conventional cigarettes reduces peripheral microcirculation 
leading to worse outcomes after hand surgery. Patients are increasingly using 
electronic cigarettes (eCigarettes); however, there is no published research 
investigating the effects of eCigarettes on hand microcirculation.
METHODS: Fifteen healthy subjects with a median age of 26 years were recruited: 
7 smokers and 8 nonsmokers. A noninvasive O2C laser Doppler probe measured a 
baseline control reading at deep (7-mm) and superficial (3-mm) levels. 
Participants commenced a 5-minute smoking protocol of nonnicotine (0-mg) 
eCigarettes with continuous microcirculation measurements during smoking and for 
20 minutes afterward. This was repeated with nicotine (24-mg) 
eCigarettes. Readings were averaged over 5-minute periods and standardized as a 
percentage of baseline. A linear mixed-effects model with an unstructured 
covariance structure was used to analyze the data.
RESULTS: Smokers had a statistically significant reduction in hand 
microcirculation during and up to 20 minutes after smoking a 24-mg eCigarette. 
There was a maximum reduction of 77% in superficial flow and 29% in deep flow. 
After smoking a 0-mg eCigarette, smokers demonstrated an increase in superficial 
flow of up to 70% with no change in deep flow. Nonsmokers had no statistically 
significant change in superficial or deep flow after smoking either eCigarette.
CONCLUSIONS: A 24-mg eCigarette significantly reduced smokers' hand 
microcirculation during and after smoking. Microcirculation increased in smokers 
after inhalation of a 0-mg eCigarette.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: We advise smokers undergoing hand surgery to avoid high-dose 
eCigarettes and, if necessary, to use 0-mg eCigarettes as an alternative.

Humans are exposed to furan, a toxicant and possible human carcinogen, through 
multiple sources including diet and tobacco smoke. The urinary metabolites of 
furan are derived from the reaction of its toxic metabolite with protein 
nucleophiles and are biomarkers of exposure and potential harm. An established 
isotopic dilution liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry method was used to 
measure these biomarkers in urine from users of e-cigarettes, cannabis, and/or 
combustible tobacco with/without reduced nicotine levels. Amounts of furan 
mercapturic acid metabolites were higher in these individuals relative to 
nonsmokers, indicating that they may be at risk for potential furan-derived 
toxicities.

BACKGROUND: Smoking is a leading cause of numerous human disorders including 
pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Disease development is 
primarily caused by exposure to cigarette smoke constituents, many of which are 
known toxicants. Switching smokers to modified risk tobacco products (MRTPs) has 
been suggested as a potential means to reduce the risks of tobacco use, by 
reducing such exposure.
METHODS: This randomized, controlled study investigated whether biomarkers of 
toxicant exposure (BoE) were reduced when smokers switched from smoking 
combustible cigarettes to using a novel (glo™/THP1.0) or in-market comparator 
(iQOS/THS) tobacco heating product (THP). One hundred eighty Japanese smokers 
smoked combustible cigarettes during a 2-day baseline period, followed by 
randomization to either continue smoking cigarettes, switch to using mentholated 
or non-mentholated variants of glo™, switch to using a non-mentholated variant 
of iQOS, or quit nicotine and tobacco product use completely for 5 days. 
Baseline and post-randomization 24-h urine samples were collected for BoE 
analysis. Carbon monoxide was measured daily in exhaled breath (eCO).
RESULTS: On day 5 after switching, urinary BoE (excluding for nicotine) and eCO 
levels were significantly (p < .05) reduced by medians between 20.9% and 92.1% 
compared with baseline in all groups either using glo™ or iQOS or quitting 
tobacco use. Between-group comparisons revealed that the reductions in the glo™ 
groups were similar (p > .05) to quitting in many cases.
CONCLUSIONS: glo™ or iQOS use for 5 days reduced exposure to smoke toxicants in 
a manner comparable to quitting tobacco use. THPs are reduced exposure tobacco 
products with the potential to be MRTPs.
IMPLICATIONS: This clinical study demonstrates that when smokers switched from 
smoking combustible cigarettes to using tobacco heating products their exposure 
to smoke toxicants was significantly decreased. In many cases, this was to the 
same extent as that seen when they quit smoking completely. This may indicate 
that these products have the potential to be reduced exposure and/or reduced 
risk tobacco products when used by smokers whose cigarette consumption is 
displaced completely.

INTRODUCTION: Tobacco harm reduction aims to provide reduced risk alternatives 
to adult smokers who would otherwise continue smoking combustible cigarettes 
(CCs). This randomized, open-label, three-arm, parallel-group, single-center, 
short-term confinement study aimed to investigate the effects of exposure to 
selected harmful and potentially harmful constituents (HPHCs) of cigarette smoke 
in adult smokers who switched to a carbon-heated tobacco product (CHTP) compared 
with adult smokers who continued to smoke CCs and those who abstained from 
smoking for 5 days.
METHODS: Biomarkers of exposure to HPHCs, including nicotine and urinary 
excretion of mutagenic material, were measured in 24-hour urine and blood 
samples in 112 male and female Caucasian smokers switching from CCs to the CHTP 
ad libitum use. Puffing topography was assessed during product use.
RESULTS: Switching to the CHTP or smoking abstinence (SA) resulted in marked 
decreases from baseline to Day 5 in all biomarkers of exposure measured, 
including carboxyhemoglobin (43% and 55% decrease in the CHTP and SA groups, 
respectively). The urinary excretion of mutagenic material was also markedly 
decreased on Day 5 compared with baseline (89% and 87% decrease in the CHTP and 
SA groups, respectively). No changes in biomarkers of exposure to HPHCs or 
urinary mutagenic material were observed between baseline and Day 5 in the CC 
group.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide clear evidence supporting a reduction in the 
level of exposure to HPHCs of tobacco smoke in smokers who switch to CHTP under 
controlled conditions, similar to that observed in SA.
IMPLICATIONS: The reductions observed in biomarkers of exposure to HPHCs of 
tobacco smoke in this short-term study could potentially also reduce the 
incidence of cancer, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases in those smokers 
who switch to a heated tobacco product.

BACKGROUND: There is scarce evidence about passive exposure to the vapour 
released or exhaled from electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) under real 
conditions. The aim of this study is to characterise passive exposure to 
nicotine from e-cigarettes' vapour and conventional cigarettes' smoke at home 
among non-smokers under real-use conditions.
METHODS: We conducted an observational study with 54 non-smoker volunteers from 
different homes: 25 living at home with conventional smokers, 5 living with 
nicotine e-cigarette users, and 24 from control homes (not using conventional 
cigarettes neither e-cigarettes). We measured airborne nicotine at home and 
biomarkers (cotinine in saliva and urine). We calculated geometric mean (GM) and 
geometric standard deviations (GSD). We also performed ANOVA and Student's t 
tests for the log-transformed data. We used Bonferroni-corrected t-tests to 
control the family error rate for multiple comparisons at 5%.
RESULTS: The GMs of airborne nicotine were 0.74 μg/m(3) (GSD=4.05) in the 
smokers' homes, 0.13 μg/m(3) (GSD=2.4) in the e-cigarettes users' homes, and 
0.02 μg/m(3) (GSD=3.51) in the control homes. The GMs of salivary cotinine were 
0.38 ng/ml (GSD=2.34) in the smokers' homes, 0.19 ng/ml (GSD=2.17) in the 
e-cigarettes users' homes, and 0.07 ng/ml (GSD=1.79) in the control homes. 
Salivary cotinine concentrations of the non-smokers exposed to e-cigarette's 
vapour at home (all exposed ≥ 2 h/day) were statistically significant different 
that those found in non-smokers exposed to second-hand smoke ≥ 2 h/day and in 
non-smokers from control homes.
CONCLUSIONS: The airborne markers were statistically higher in conventional 
cigarette homes than in e-cigarettes homes (5.7 times higher). However, 
concentrations of both biomarkers among non-smokers exposed to conventional 
cigarettes and e-cigarettes' vapour were statistically similar (only 2 and 1.4 
times higher, respectively). The levels of airborne nicotine and cotinine 
concentrations in the homes with e-cigarette users were higher than control 
homes (differences statistically significant). Our results show that non-smokers 
passively exposed to e-cigarettes absorb nicotine.

BACKGROUND: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are environmental pollutants 
formed from incomplete combustion of organic matter; some PAHs are carcinogens. 
Smoking, diet, and other activities contribute to exposure to PAHs. Exposure 
data to PAHs among combustible tobacco product users (e.g. cigarette smokers) 
exist; however, among non-combustible tobacco products users (e.g., e-cigarette 
users), such data are rather limited.
OBJECTIVES: We sought to evaluate exposure to PAHs among participants in Wave 1 
(2013-2014) of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study 
based on the type of tobacco product (combustible vs non-combustible), and 
frequency and intensity of product use.
METHODS: We quantified seven PAH urinary biomarkers in 11,519 PATH Study 
participants. From self-reported information, we categorized 8327 participants 
based on their use of tobacco products as never-tobacco user (never user, 
n = 1700), exclusive current established combustible products user (combustible 
products user, n = 5767), and exclusive current established non-combustible 
products user (non-combustible products user, n = 860). We further classified 
tobacco users as exclusive cigarette user (cigarette user, n = 3964), exclusive 
smokeless product user (SLT user, n = 509), and exclusive e-cigarette user 
(e-cigarette user, n = 280). Last, we categorized frequency of product use 
(everyday vs some days) and time since use (last hour, within 3 days, over 
3 days). We calculated geometric mean (GM) concentrations, and evaluated 
associations between tobacco product user categories and PAH biomarkers 
concentrations.
RESULTS: Combustible products users had significantly higher GMs of all 
biomarkers than non-combustible products users and never users; non-combustible 
products users had significantly higher GMs than never users for four of seven 
biomarkers. For all biomarkers examined, cigarette users had the highest GMs 
compared to other tobacco-product users. Interestingly, GMs of 
2-hydroxyfluorene, 3-hydroxyfluorene and ∑2,3-hydroxyphenanthrene were 
significantly higher in SLT users than in e-cigarette users; 3-hydroxyfluorene 
and 1-hydroxypyrene were also significantly higher in e-cigarette and SLT users 
than in never users. Everyday cigarette and SLT users had significantly higher 
GMs for most biomarkers than some days' users; cigarette and SLT users who used 
the product in the last hour had significantly higher GMs of most biomarkers 
than other occasional cigarette or SLT users respectively. By contrast, everyday 
e-cigarette users' GMs of most biomarkers did not differ significantly from 
those in some days' e-cigarette users; we did not observe clear trends by time 
of last use among e-cigarette users.
CONCLUSIONS: Users of tobacco products had higher PAH urinary biomarker 
concentrations compared to never users, and concentrations differed by type and 
frequency of tobacco product use.

Presented is an ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatographic tandem mass 
spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method developed for the detection of propylene 
glycol, glycerol, ethylene glycol and diethylene glycol using isotopically 
labeled standards in urine as part of ongoing studies to evaluate whether 
urinary propylene glycol and/or vegetable glycerin concentration are indicators 
of recent use. Propylene glycol and vegetable glycerol are found in many 
products that are consumed and used including electronic cigarettes 
(e-cigarettes). E-cigarettes are battery-powered devices used as an alternative 
to traditional cigarettes. The liquid formulations aerosolized in these devices 
largely consist of propylene glycol and/or vegetable glycerol. Published reports 
regarding the ratio of propylene glycol to glycerol content in these 
formulations ranged from 50:50 to 100 percent of either. For the analysis of 
urine specimens from both users and non-users of e-cigarettes, calibrators, 
controls and specimens were derivatized using benzoyl chloride prior to 
analysis. They were analyzed using a Waters AcQuity Xevo TQ-S Micro UPLC-MS/MS. 
Chromatographic separation was performed on an AcQuity UPLC BEH C18 1.7 um, 
2.1 × 50 mm, column using a 20 mM ammonium formate in water and 20 mM ammonium 
formate in methanol as the mobile phase. The method was validated using SWGTOX 
guidelines for linearity, precision and accuracy, stability, carryover and limit 
of detection. The linear range was determined using a seven-point calibration 
curve ranging between 0.5 and 100 mcg/mL. The bias for all validation controls 
was determined to be ±20% of the expected concentrations with CVs of <15%. A 
total of 124 urine specimens analyzed collected with 50 specimens collected from 
self-reported non-smokers (cigarettes/e-cigarettes) confirmed cotinine free 
using the DRI® Cotinine Assay (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) and 74 specimens 
collected before and after 12 hours self-reported e-cigarettes abstinence 
e-cigarette users. Propylene glycol and glycerol were determined to have 
concentration ranges of "none detected" to 1470 and "none detected" to 
2950 mcg/mL, respectively.

AIMS/INTRODUCTION: The present study evaluated the ability of lipid accumulation 
product (LAP), visceral adiposity index (VAI), and the product of triglycerides 
and glucose (TyG), three novel markers, in identifying metabolic syndrome (MetS) 
with different criteria in middle-aged and elderly Chinese.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: During June 2012 to January 2013, 992 consecutive 
patients (age ≥40 years) were enrolled at Daping Hospital. The criteria of MetS 
were based on the International Diabetes Federation and the modified National 
Cholesterol Education Program's Adult Treatment Panel III. VAI, LAP and TyG were 
computed based on a published mathematical model.
RESULTS: The prevalence of MetS was 42.8%. The receiver operating characteristic 
curve found LAP, VAI and TyG were positively related to MetS in both criteria.

Federation criteria were 2.015, 31.465 and 8.706, and 2.035, 37.99 and 8.697, 
respectively. After adjustment of potential confounding factors, VAI, LAP and 
TyG were significantly correlated with MetS in all criteria according to optimal 
cut-offs. For MetS, reliable predictive value was observed in different 
subgroups (age and sex). LAP showed the greatest area under the curve in MetS 
with the International Diabetes Federation definition (area under the curve 
0.887, 95% confidence interval 0.852-0.922).
CONCLUSIONS: AP, VAI and TyG were reliable surrogate markers for identifying 
MetS in middle-aged and elderly Chinese. LAP could be a better parameter than 
VAI and TyG for predicting MetS in the present study.

Three Patients With Acute Pulmonary Damage Following the Use of E-Cigarettes-A 
Case Series.

Respiratory Medicine, Städtisches Klinikum Braunschweig.

BACKGROUND: The use of e-cigarettes is on the rise around the world. Many case 
reports of acute lung injury due to e-cigarette use have been published in 
recent months in the USA, but no comparable cases have emerged in Germany up to 
the present report. The use of e-cigarettes has risen very rapidly in the USA in 
recent years, simultaneously with the legalization of marijuana sale in many 
American states. Most of the cases described there involved the use, not only of 
nicotine, but of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, the psychoactive ingredient in 
marijuana) as well, though some of the patients had indeed not used additives 
(e.g. THC).
METHODS: We report three cases in Germany of acute pulmonary illness that we 
consider to have been caused by the use of e-cigarettes.
RESULTS: All three patients were hospitalized for acute shortness of breath. Two 
displayed partial respiratory insufficiency and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. 
All three stated that they had used ordinary, commercially available 
e-cigarettes every day for at least the past three months. In the first patient, 
a 48-year-old man, the complete blood count and bronchial lavage findings 
indicated eosinophilic inflammation. The second patient, a 22-year-old man, 
developed multiple episodes of hemoptysis, with computed tomography (CT) showing 
diffuse alveolar bleeding; his complete blood count also revealed eosinophilic 
inflammation. The third patient, a 34-year-old man, displayed acute ground-glass 
lung opacities as well as fibrosing changes on CT corresponding to pulmonary 
sarcoidosis. All three recovered on high-dose systemic corticosteroid treatment 
and were discharged from the hospital in 2 to 12 days.
CONCLUSION: In the first two cases, acute pulmonary injury was very likely due 
to e-cigarette consumption, as all other possible causes were ruled out. A 
possible link to e-cigarette use was present in the third case. We thus describe 
the first three suspected cases of acute lung disease due to e-cigarette use in 
Germany. These patients do not share any common, typical clinical picture; 
rather, their symptoms represent different components of the wide spectrum of 
interstitial lung disease. A uniform national registry should be established to 
improve our understanding of the adverse effects of e-cigarettes and the 
resulting acute and chronic changes in the lungs.

PURPOSE: Electronic cigarettes are growing in popularity, but the physiological 
consequences of vaporized nicotine are unknown.
METHODS: Twenty healthy non-smokers inhaled vaporized nicotine and placebo 
(randomized).
RESULTS: Nicotine inhalation was associated with higher arterial pressures in 
the seated position, and increased arterial pressures in the head-up positions 
with no other effects on autonomic control.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that vaporized nicotine inhalation is not 
innocuous. Longitudinal studies in otherwise healthy non-smokers should be 
conducted.

We report the findings from a randomized, parallel study designed to evaluate 
nicotine pharmacokinetics (PK) following 10 min of ad libitum use of electronic 
nicotine delivery system (ENDS) in four flavor variants. Subjects were 
randomized an investigational product (IP) and blood samples were collected for 
PK assessments during a test session. Primary endpoints were baseline-adjusted 
values of maximum plasma nicotine concentration (Cmax) and area under the 
nicotine concentration-vs-time curve up to 60 min (AUCnic0-60). 
Baseline-adjusted mean Cmax ranged from 6.53 to 8.21 ng/mL, and mean AUCnic0-60 
ranged from 206.87 to 263.52 ng min/mL for all ENDS IPs. Results of geometric 
mean Cmax and AUCnic0-60 values were within 95% confidence intervals (CI) among 
the ENDS IP flavor variants tested.

The association between smoking and postoperative complications is compounded in 
patients who have oral and maxillofacial operations by an additional local 
effect, and patients often continue to smoke after operation despite advice to 
stop. Recent studies have suggested that nicotine may reduce inflammation and 
improve angiogenesis, so topical application may be beneficial for smokers. The 
electronic cigarette is increasing in popularity and more patients ask whether 
they can vape after operation. We investigated the effect of electronic 
cigarettes (of which half contained nicotine and half did not) on blood flow in 
the buccal mucosa in 10 volunteers immediately after vaping. Smokers were 
excluded as this was considered an additional variable in a small pilot study 
and our Trust has a no-smoking policy. After vaping for 5 minutes, capillary 
blood flow was measured in the buccal mucosa at 5-minute intervals using a laser 
Doppler probe, and the results were expressed as arbitrary perfusion units. 
There was a wide variation in results and a small but significant rise (p=0.008) 
as a result of nicotine vaping, but these fell to the same levels as before 
within 30 minutes. Electronic cigarettes may have an effect on blood flow to the 
oral mucosa, although further studies are needed to show whether they improve 
healing time after operation. Additional work is also needed to compare them 
with cigarettes.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Tobacco is a carcinogen that is closely associated with the 
occurrence of lung cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The 
consumption of tobacco is also leading to alterations in different immune cell 
subtypes. However, the impact of different conventional and alternative smoking 
sources on human monocytes remains elusive.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, we investigated the influence of aqueous 
extracts of different sources of smoking (cigarettes; heated tobacco product 
IQOS; e-cigarettes with and without nicotine; nicotine pouches) on different 
monocytic adhesion molecules, chemokine receptors and checkpoint molecule PD-L1 
by flow cytometry. Cytokine expression patterns were evaluated using human 
cytokine arrays and the human monocyte leukemia cell line THP-1 as a model.
RESULTS: Data revealed differential effects of the analyzed conventional and 
alternative smoking devices on monocyte adhesion molecules and cytokine 
secretion. The examined smoking devices can be assigned to two differential 
monocyte activation patterns. Monocytes stimulated with aqueous extracts of 
cigarettes, e-cigarette without nicotine, and heat not burn product IQOS 
revealed distinct alterations of surface markers and cytokines compared to the 
monocyte activation pattern in response to aqueous extracts of nicotine, 
nicotine pouches, and e-cigarette with nicotine.
CONCLUSION: Our data indicate differential immunological consequences of 
different conventional and alternative smoking sources with and without 
nicotine. Further comprehensive analysis as well as in vivo investigations on 
peripheral blood monocyte subsets from smoking individuals using different 
smoking sources are required to better understand the impact on monocyte 
characteristics, especially with regard to the development of cancer.

INTRODUCTION: Tobacco Heating System (THS) 2.2, a candidate modified-risk 
tobacco product, aims at offering an alternative to cigarettes for smokers while 
substantially reducing the exposure to harmful and potentially harmful 
constituents found in cigarette smoke.
METHODS: One hundred and sixty healthy adult US smokers participated in this 
randomized, three-arm parallel group, controlled clinical study. Subjects were 
randomized in a 2:1:1 ratio to menthol Tobacco Heating System 2.2 (mTHS), 
menthol cigarette, or smoking abstinence for 5 days in confinement and 86 
subsequent ambulatory days. Endpoints included biomarkers of exposure to harmful 
and potentially harmful constituents (reported in our co-publication, Part 1) 
and biomarkers of potential harm (BOPH).
RESULTS: Compliance (protocol and allocated product exposure) was 51% and 18% in 
the mTHS and smoking abstinence arms, respectively, on day 90. Nonetheless, 
favorable changes in BOPHs of lipid metabolism (total cholesterol and high- and 
low-density cholesterol), endothelial dysfunction (soluble intercellular 
adhesion molecule-1), oxidative stress (8-epi-prostaglandin F2α), and 
cardiovascular risk factors (eg, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein) were 
observed in the mTHS group. Favorable effects in other BOPHs, including ones 
related to platelet activation (11-dehydrothromboxane B2) and metabolic syndrome 
(glucose), were more pronounced in normal weight subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the reduced exposure demonstrated when 
switching to mTHS is associated with overall improvements in BOPHs, which are 
indicative of pathomechanistic pathways underlying the development of 
smoking-related diseases, with some stronger effects in normal weight subjects.
IMPLICATIONS: Switching to mTHS was associated with favorable changes for some 
BOPHs indicative of biological pathway alterations (eg, oxidative stress and 
endothelial dysfunction). The results suggest that switching to mTHS has the 
potential to reduce the adverse health effects of smoking and ultimately the 
risk of smoking-related diseases. Switching to mTHS for 90 days led to 
reductions in a number of biomarkers of exposure in smokers, relative to those 
who continued smoking cigarettes, which were close to those observed when 
stopping smoking (reported in our co-publication, Part 1). Initial findings 
suggest reduced levels of 8-epi-prostaglandin F2α and intercellular adhesion 
molecule 1, when switching to mTHS for 90 days. These changes are comparable to 
what is observed upon smoking cessation. In normal weight subjects, additional 
favorable changes were seen in 11-dehydrothromboxane B2, fibrinogen, 
homocysteine, hs-CRP, percentage of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 
second, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, glucose, high-density 
lipoprotein, apolipoprotein A1, and triglycerides.

BACKGROUND: GRACE risk score models are capable of predicting all-cause 
mortality of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) patients. However, 
its utility for evaluating major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in NSTEMI 
patients with multivessel disease (MVD) remains unclear.
METHODS AND RESULTS: This study was designed as a retrospective cohort study 
that recruited patients with NSTEMI and multivessel disease between September 
2013 and December 2018 in Daping Hospital, Chongqing, China. The primary outcome 
was a composite outcome that included all-cause mortality, recurrent angina, 
non-fatal myocardial infarction, coronary re-vascularization, and non-fatal 
strokes. Of the 827 patients with NSTEMI, 32 did not complete follow-up and 430 
were excluded because of single-vessel disease. The remaining 365 NSTEMI 
patients with MVD had a median follow-up of 3.0 (IQR 2.6-3.3) years, 78 patients 
experienced outcomes. The GRACE risk score predicted the MACE (hazard ratio 
1.014, 95% CI 1.006-1.021, P < 0.001). The GRACE risk score performed well in 
predicting all-cause mortality (c-statistic 0.72, 95% CI 0.59-0.85, P = 0.001) 
in MVD but was less powerful in predicting MACE (c-statistic 0.69, 95% CI 
0.62-0.75, P < 0.001). When combining the GRACE risk score with the SYNTAX 
score, and blood urea nitrogen for predicting all-cause mortality and MACE 
events, the c-statistic value increased to 0.82 and 0.81 (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: In NSTEMI patients with MVD, the GRACE score showed an acceptable 
predictive value for all-cause mortality, but it was less powerful in predicting 
MACE. Blood urea nitrogen may be valuable in assessing long-term cardiovascular 
events in patients with MVD.

of Vaping?

An adolescent girl with a history of frequent electronic cigarette use of 
nicotine was hospitalized with severe necrotizing pneumonia. Blood cultures 
obtained before the administration of empirical broad-spectrum intravenous 
antibiotics had positive results for the growth of Fusobacterium necrophorum The 
pathogen is an uncommon but well-known cause of anaerobic pneumonia with unique 
features that are collectively referred to as Lemierre syndrome or postanginal 
sepsis. The syndrome begins as a pharyngeal infection. Untreated, the infection 
progresses to involve the ipsilateral internal jugular vein, resulting in septic 
thrombophlebitis with direct spread from the neck to the lungs causing 
multifocal necrotizing pneumonia. The teenager we present in this report had 
neither a preceding pharyngeal infection nor Doppler ultrasonographic evidence 
for the presence of deep neck vein thrombi, leading us to explore alternative 
mechanisms for her pneumonia. We propose the possibility that her behavior of 
frequent vaping led to sufficient pharyngeal irritation such that F necrophorum 
colonizing her oropharynx was inhaled directly into her lungs during electronic 
cigarette use. Preexisting, but not yet recognized, vaping-related lung injury 
may have also contributed to her risk of developing the infection. The patient 
was hospitalized for 10 days. At follow-up one month later, she still became 
short of breath with minimal exertion.

Not only smoking is deadly: fatal ingestion of e-juice-a case report.

Germany.

A fatal case of nicotine intoxication by oral intake of a nicotine solution, 
sold via the Internet, is reported. The concentrated nicotine solution (72 
mg/mL) is usually diluted with polypropylene, polyethylene glycol or glycerine, 
respectively, in order to allow the user to generate their own solution for 
vaporisation in electronic cigarettes (e-juice). A 34-year-old man was found 
lifeless by his parents, who reported that their son had been in good health and 
had shown no hints of suicidal behaviour. The medicolegal autopsy revealed 
unspecific findings. Toxicological analysis revealed nicotine concentrations of 
5.5 mg/L in femoral venous blood, 136 mg/L in heart blood, 12.0 mg/kg in brain 
tissue, 42.6 mg/kg in kidney tissue, 89.5 mg/kg in lung tissue and a total 
amount of 3,950 mg in the gastric contents. Cotinine concentrations were 0.9 
mg/L in femoral venous blood, 7.6 mg/L in heart blood, 0.4 mg/kg in brain 
tissue, 0.9 mg/kg in kidney tissue and 0.8 mg/kg in lung tissue. No cotinine was 
detected in the gastric contents. The nicotine level measured in the femoral 
blood was in good accordance with the levels reported in other fatal cases 
caused by oral or patch application of nicotine. Moreover, the high level of 
nicotine in lung and kidney tissue, compared to that within femoral blood, 
strikingly emphasises the strong effect of post-mortem redistribution, 
underlined by the comparably low concentration of nicotine in the brain. The 
extremely high level of nicotine in the heart blood is more likely due to the 
high concentration in the gastric contents, due to oral intake, and by 
accumulation of the basic substance in the acidic gastric contents. This further 
highlights the effect of post-mortem redistribution. The mother of the deceased 
later admitted that her son had been suffering from psychosis and that she found 
a package containing five nicotine solution vials of the brand "Titanium Ice" 
(of 50 mL each). Three of the vials were empty. The nicotine concentration in 
the e-juice Titanium Ice was confirmed by HPLC analysis.

OBJECTIVES: Real-world evidence on exposure to harmful and potentially harmful 
constituents (HPHCs) and on biological effects in cigarette smokers who switch 
to electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) can inform the health effects of 
switching.
AIMS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional, observational study assessed adults who 
had smoked ≥10 cigarettes/day for ≥10 years, comparing 124 continuing cigarette 
smokers (Smokers) to 140 former smokers who switched to JUUL-brand ENDS 
exclusively for ≥6 months (Switchers). Assessments included biomarkers of 
exposure (BOEs) to select HPHCs, biomarkers of potential harm (BOPHs) related to 
smoking-related diseases, psychometric assessments of dependence on cigarettes 
and ENDS, respectively, and respiratory symptoms. Planned analyses compared 
geometric means, adjusted for demographic covariates; further analyses adjusted 
for additional lifestyle and smoking history covariates.
RESULTS: Nicotine levels were significantly higher in Switchers (median time 
switched = 3 years), who were unusually heavy users of JUUL. All other BOEs, 
including NNAL and HPMA3 (primary endpoints), were significantly lower in 
Switchers than Smokers. Most BOPHs (sICAM-1 [primary], and eg, white blood cell 
count, MCP1, HbA1c) were significantly lower in Switchers than Smokers; HDL was 
significantly higher. Switchers reported significantly lower dependence on JUUL 
than Smokers did on cigarettes, and respiratory symptom scores were 
significantly lower among Switchers than Smokers.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared to continuing smokers, smokers who switched to JUUL had 
substantially lower exposures to multiple HPHCs, favorable differences in 
markers of inflammation, endothelial function, oxidative stress, and 
cardiovascular risk, and fewer respiratory symptoms. These findings suggest that 
switching from cigarettes to JUUL likely reduces smokers' health risks.
IMPLICATIONS: Short-term confinement studies and randomized clinical trials 
demonstrate that adult smokers who switch completely to ENDS experience 
substantial reductions in exposure to many smoking-related toxicants. This study 
extends those findings to longer periods of switching to JUUL-brand ENDS (almost 
3 years on average) under naturalistic use conditions in real-world settings and 
also found that switching to JUUL resulted in favorable differences in BOPHs 
more proximally related to smoking-induced disease, as well as in respiratory 
symptoms. Smokers who switch to ENDS reduce their exposure to toxicants, likely 
reducing their disease risk.

INTRODUCTION: Heating rather than burning tobacco reduces levels of harmful and 
potentially harmful constituents, and consumer products using this approach aim 
to reduce exposure to tobacco toxicants. The Tobacco Heating System (THS) 
version 2.1 has been enhanced from earlier prototypes with an improved heat 
control and sensorial experience and thereby user acceptance. Exposure 
measurements are required to determine whether it may be possible to reduce the 
individual health risk compared to smoking combustible cigarettes (CCs).
METHODS: This controlled clinical study randomly assigned 40 smokers to either a 
group continuing to use of their own CC brand (n = 20) or a group switching to 
THS 2.1 (n = 20) for 5 days. Biomarkers of exposure were measured at baseline 
and on day 1 through day 5. Product consumption, Human Puffing Topography, the 
occurrence of adverse events, and an assessment of subjective effects, such as 
smoking satisfaction and enjoyment of respiratory tract sensations, were also 
determined.
RESULTS: The group of smokers who switched to THS 2.1 adapted their puffing 
behavior initially through longer puff duration and more puffs. During the 
duration of the study, total puff volume returned to baseline levels and the 
mean daily product consumption increased but with similar nicotine exposure 
compared to baseline CC use. Biomarkers of exposure to tobacco smoke toxicants 
which inform product risk assessment were significantly reduced with THS use 
compared to the CC group. THS 2.1 users experienced less reinforcing effects 
with THS 2.1 than with their own cigarette brand.
CONCLUSIONS: THS 2.1 is a promising alternative to smoking CCs. Notwithstanding 
possible use adaption through consumption or puffing behavior, the exposure to 
harmful smoke constituents was markedly reduced with the new heated tobacco 
platform.
IMPLICATIONS: Exposure markers to harmful and potentially harmful smoke 
constituents were lowered with the THS 2.1. Heating tobacco instead of burning 
can offer a potentially lower risk of delivering nicotine compared to CCs.

A randomised, parallel group clinical study was performed to evaluate the safety 
profile of an e-vapour product (EVP; 2.0% nicotine) in smokers of conventional 
cigarettes (CCs) switching to use the EVP for 12 weeks. During the study, no 
clinically significant product-related findings were observed in terms of vital 
signs, electrocardiogram, lung function tests and standard clinical laboratory 
parameters. Adverse events (AEs) reported by EVP subjects were more frequent 
during the first week after switching to the EVP. The frequency of AEs reduced 
thereafter and out of a total of 1515 reported AEs, 495 were judged as being 
related to nicotine withdrawal symptoms. The most frequently stated AEs were 
headache, sore throat, desire to smoke and cough reported by 47.4, 27.8, 27.5 
and 17.0% of subjects, respectively. Only 6% of AEs were judged as probably or 
definitely related to the EVP. Additional observations in EVP subjects included 
a decrease in the level of urine nicotine equivalents by up to 33.8%, and 
decreases in the level of three biomarkers of exposure to toxicants known to be 
present in CC smoke (benzene, acrolein and 
4-[methylnitrosamino]-1-[3-pyridyl]-1-butanone). The decrease in nicotine 
equivalents coincided with an increase in nicotine withdrawal symptoms, measured 
by a questionnaire, which subsided after two weeks. The data presented here 
shows the potential EVPs may offer smokers looking for an alternative to CCs.

A 22-year-old man was hospitalized after stating he would 'commit suicide in a 
non-detectable way'. He was admitted with a severe necrotizing pancreatitis and 
acute kidney injury, evolving to multiple organ failure. His condition rapidly 
deteriorated, and he died 11 days after hospital admission. Postmortem 
histopathology confirmed fulminant necrotizing pancreatitis, acute tubular 
necrosis, cerebral edema, pericentral/midzonal hepatocellular necrosis and acute 
respiratory distress syndrome. Metabolites of 4F-MDMB-BINACA, a synthetic 
cannabinoid, were detected in urine and serum collected at hospital admission. 
The same drug was found in a vapor fluid found in the man's apartment. As 
cannabis use has been etiologically linked to acute pancreatitis, we hypothesize 
that the more afferent and potent 4F-MDMB-BINACA could induce acute pancreatitis 
via stimulation of cannabinoid (CB)1-receptors. Alternatively, terminal 
fluorination could have induced a dose-dependent toxic effect on a wide range of 
cellular processes, leading to cell dysfunction and death. This is the first 
clinicopathological description of a lethal intoxication with 4F-MDMB-BINACA, 
following extensive vaping. Toxic effects could either relate to CB-receptor 
binding or to direct fluoride toxicity.

BACKGROUND: The relationship between anxiety, depression, and metabolic 
parameters and the incidence of breast nodules is unclear. This study aims to 
investigate the association between female breast nodules and anxiety, 
depression and metabolic factors.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study recruited 857 individuals with biological 
indicators and breast ultrasound data from the Daping hospital from April 2021 
to February 2022. Serum samples were used to measure fasting blood glucose, uric 
acid, triglycerides, total cholesterol, urea nitrogen, alanine transaminase, 
aspartate transaminase, albumin, high-density lipoprotein, low-density 
lipoprotein. Self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) and self-rating depression scale 
(SDS) were used to assess the level of anxiety and depression.
RESULT: The positive rate of breast nodules in women aged 40 to 49 years old was 
significantly higher than that of other age women. The proportion of 
participants aged 40-49 years old in the group with breast nodules was 
significantly higher than that in the group without breast nodules (34.6% vs. 
16.9%, p<0.001). Breast nodules in postmenopausal women were significantly lower 
than those in premenopausal women (26.4% vs. 73.6%, p = 0.026). The SAS scores 
of women with breast nodules were higher than those of the no-nodules group 
(40.99 ± 8.45 vs. 38.94 ± 6.89, p<0.001), same as the SDS scores (41.97 ± 10.33 
vs. 38.91 ± 7.60, p < 0.001). The number of women suffering from anxiety in the 
group of breast nodules was significantly higher than that in control (13.8% vs. 
4.5%, p < 0.001), and the number of depression in the group of breast nodules 
was also significantly higher than that of in control (14.4% vs. 4.5%, p < 
0.001). Women with breast nodules showed a slightly lower uric acid level than 
those without breast nodules (290.11 ± 65.32 vs. 301.43 ± 65.93 umol/L, p 
= 0.016). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that age, menopausal 
status, anxiety and depression status were significantly associated with the 
presence of breast nodules, but there was no significant difference in uric 
acid.
CONCLUSION: Our findings offer insight into the occurrence of depression and 
anxiety in the breast nodules of Chinese women. Anxiety and depression status, 
age and menopausal status may be the independent risk factors for the occurrence 
of breast nodules.

In addition to smoking cessation, for those who would otherwise continue to 
smoke, replacing cigarettes with less harmful alternatives can reduce the harms 
of smoking. Heating instead of burning tobacco reduces, or eliminates, the 
formation of harmful and potentially harmful constituents (HPHC) that are found 
in cigarette smoke. The Carbon-Heated Tobacco Product (CHTP), a heat-not-burn 
tobacco product, mimics the cigarette smoking ritual. This randomized, 
open-label, two-arm, parallel-group, short-term confinement study tested the 
hypothesis that the geometric means of the BoExp levels for subjects switching 
to CHTP 1.0 for 5 days are lower relative to those continuing to smoke 
cigarettes. Biomarkers of exposure (BoExp), including nicotine, urinary 
excretion of mutagenic constituents (Ames test), and cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 
activity, were measured in blood and/or 24-h urine samples during ad libitum 
product use. Nicotine exposure remained at similar levels in individuals using 
CHTP as in those continuing to smoke cigarettes. Switching to CHTP resulted in 
marked decreases in all other urinary BoExp (56-97%), carboxyhemoglobin (59%), 
urinary mutagenic constituents, and CYP1A2 activity compared with continued 
cigarette smoking. Our results provide evidence of decreased exposure to 15 
selected HPHCs in smokers switching from cigarettes to exclusive CHTP use.Trial

There is a growing evidence for the public health hazards associated with 
waterpipe tobacco smoking (WTS). While the adverse effects of WTS exposure 
during pregnancy on the offspring are widely reported, its impact during 
breastfeeding remains less understood. The effects of WTS exposure during 
lactation on the reproductive hormones and oxidative stress biomarkers of adult 
male progeny were examined. Lactating rats received either fresh air (controls) 
or mainstream WTS for 1 h twice/day from day 4 to day 21 of lactation. The 
offspring was then followed up until week 20. The data indicated that WTS 
exposure in the lactating animals reduced the levels of follicle-stimulating 
hormone (FSH), prolactin (P < 0.05), luteinizing hormone (LH) (P = 0.1146), and 
estradiol (P = 0.0773) in the blood in male progeny. While the activities of 
testicular superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and the 
levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and blood levels of 
testosterone (P >0.05) remained unaltered, the activity of catalase increased 
significantly indicating an increased oxidant load in the WTS exposed rats 
compared to the controls. WTS exposure during lactation impairs male 
reproductive hormonal profile, augments oxidative damage, and potentially 
affects male fertility in male offspring rats.

As part of current harm reduction strategies, candidate modified risk tobacco 
products (MRTP) are developed to offer adult smokers who want to continue using 
tobacco product an alternative to cigarettes while potentially reducing 
individual risk and population harm compared to smoking cigarettes. One of these 
candidate MRTPs is the Tobacco Heating System (THS) 2.2 which does not burn 
tobacco, but instead heats it, thus producing significantly reduced levels of 
harmful and potentially harmful constituents (HPHC) compared with combustible 
cigarettes (CC). A controlled, parallel group, open-label clinical study was 
conducted with subjects randomized to three monitored groups: (1) switching from 
CCs to THS2.2; (2) continuous use of non-menthol CC brand (CC arm); or (3) 
smoking abstinence (SA arm) for five days. Exposure response was assessed by 
measuring biomarkers of exposure to selected HPHCs. To complement the classical 
exposure response measurements, we have used the previously reported whole blood 
derived gene signature that can distinguish current smokers from either 
non-smokers or former smokers with high specificity and sensitivity. We tested 
the small signature consisting of only 11 genes on the blood transcriptome of 
subjects enrolled in the clinical study and showed a reduced exposure response 
in subjects that either stopped smoking or switched to a candidate MRTP, the 
THS2.2, compared with subjects who continued smoking their regular tobacco 
product.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical relevance of the TLR4 11367 polymorphism 
in patients with major trauma.
DESIGN: Genetic functional and association study.
SETTING: Daping Hospital and Chongqing Emergency Medical Center, Chongqing, 
China.
PATIENTS: A total of 132 patients with major trauma were prospectively 
recruited.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The TLR4 11367 polymorphism was genotyped using 
single-tube, bidirectional, allele-specific amplification method. Whole 
peripheral blood samples obtained within 24 hours after admission were 
stimulated with lipopolysaccharide and then tested for production of tumor 
necrosis factor alpha and interleukin 6. Sepsis morbidity rate and multiple 
organ dysfunction scores were assessed.
RESULTS: The 11367 polymorphism was shown to be strongly associated with less 
capacity of peripheral leukocytes to produce tumor necrosis factor alpha and 
interleukin 6 in response to ex vivo lipopolysaccharide stimulation in patients 
with trauma at admission. Results from association study indicated that patients 
with trauma who carry the 11367C allele were less likely to have sepsis and 
multiple organ dysfunction.
CONCLUSIONS: Combined with our previous in vitro functional study, the results 
suggest that the TLR4 11367 polymorphism might be a good predictor of who is 
more likely to develop complications such as sepsis or multiple organ 
dysfunction syndrome, depending on genotype.

Although electronic cigarettes (ECs) are a much less harmful alternative to 
tobacco cigarettes, there is concern as to whether long-term ECs use may cause 
risks to human health. We report health outcomes (blood pressure, heart rate, 
body weight, lung function, respiratory symptoms, exhaled breath nitric oxide 
[eNO], exhaled carbon monoxide [eCO], and high-resolution computed tomography 
[HRCT] of the lungs) from a prospective 3.5-year observational study of a cohort 
of nine daily EC users (mean age 29.7 (±6.1) years) who have never smoked and a 
reference group of twelve never smokers. No significant changes could be 
detected over the observation period from baseline in the EC users or between EC 
users and control subjects in any of the health outcomes investigated. Moreover, 
no pathological findings could be identified on HRCT of the lungs and no 
respiratory symptoms were consistently reported in the EC user group. Although 
it cannot be excluded that some harm may occur at later stages, this study did 
not demonstrate any health concerns associated with long-term use of EC in 
relatively young users who did not also smoke tobacco.

INTRODUCTION: The Tobacco Heating System (THS) is a "heat-not-burn" tobacco 
product designed to generate significantly lower levels of harmful and 
potentially harmful constituents (HPHCs) and present lower risk of harm than 
cigarettes. This study assessed the exposure reduction to selected HPHCs in 
smokers switching to menthol Tobacco Heating System (mTHS) 2.2 compared with 
smokers continuing smoking menthol cigarettes (mCCs) and smoking abstinence (SA) 
for 5 days in a confined setting, followed by an 86-day ambulatory period.
METHODS: A total of 160 healthy adult US smokers participated in this 
randomized, three-arm parallel group, controlled clinical study. Biomarkers of 
exposure to 16 HPHCs were measured in blood and 24-hour urine. Safety was 
monitored throughout the study. Information was also gathered on product 
evaluation, product use, subjective effects, and clinical risk markers 
(co-publication Part 2).
RESULTS: Nicotine uptake was comparable in both exposure groups (mTHS:mCC ratio 
of 96% on day 90). On day 5, biomarker of exposure levels to other HPHCs were 
reduced by 51%-96% in the mTHS group compared with the mCC group, and these 
reductions were sustained for most biomarkers of exposure over ambulatory 
period. After 90 days of use, the level of satisfaction with mTHS and 
suppression of urge to smoke were comparable to mCC.
CONCLUSION: Switching from mCCs to mTHS significantly reduced the exposure to 
HPHCs to levels approaching those observed in subjects who abstained from 
smoking for the duration of the study.
IMPLICATIONS: This study compared the impact of switching to mTHS on biomarkers 
of exposure, relative to continued smoking or SA.

OBJECTIVES: American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) adults use smokeless tobacco 
products (eg, chewing and dip tobacco) more often than other racial/ethnic 
groups do. Although US adults increasingly use potentially reduced exposure 
tobacco products (PREPs), such as electronic cigarettes and snus, no studies 
have examined the use of PREPs among AI/AN smokeless tobacco users. We examined 
associations between current PREPs use and smokeless tobacco-related measures, 
including cessation attempts and cotinine levels, in a sample of American Indian 
adults who currently use smokeless tobacco.
METHODS: We collected survey and tobacco biomarker data from 299 adult American 
Indian smokeless tobacco users at Cherokee Nation health care facilities and 
events in 2016 and 2017. We used multivariable analyses to determine 
associations between current PREPs use and smokeless tobacco-related 
characteristics.
RESULTS: Current PREPs users were younger, less likely to be married or living 
with a partner, less likely to report a chronic medical condition, and more 
likely to report other tobacco use than PREPs nonusers. Among participants with 
annual household incomes ≤$30 000, current PREPs users were less likely than 
PREPs nonusers to report a definite desire to quit smokeless tobacco (P = .02). 
PREPs use was not associated with planning to quit smokeless tobacco, past 
12-month smokeless tobacco quit attempts, amount of smokeless tobacco used per 
week, cotinine levels, or scores on the Fagerström Test for Nicotine 
Dependence-Smokeless Tobacco.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that American Indian smokeless tobacco users may 
not be using PREPs as a smokeless tobacco cessation aid. Future studies should 
take this finding into consideration when evaluating the role of PREPs use in 
smokeless tobacco cessation and in total tobacco cessation in this population.

During the last decade, a substantial growth in new psychoactive substances 
(NPS) has been recorded. Within this group, a considerably fast-growing 
sub-group is represented by the opioids, which are based on modifications of the 
fentanyl structure. In this study, identification and analytical 
characterization of a new fentanyl derivative, 4-fluorobutyrfentanyl 
(1-((4-fluorophenyl)(1-phenethylpiperidin-4-yl)amino)butan-1-one, 4-FBF), is 
described. Apart from the seized powder, 4-FBF was also identified in the 
e-cigarette liquid secured in Case 1. The concentration of the compound in the 
liquid was 35 mg/mL. The main component of the liquid was glycerol, and nicotine 
was also present. This substance was detected in seized material that originated 
from the illegal drug market in Poland. To the best of the authors' knowledge, 
this report presents the first two analytically confirmed cases of fatal 
intoxication associated with 4-FBF. Case 1 was a 26-year-old male drug user who 
was found dead at home. Case 2 was a 25-year-old female, occasional user of NPS 
and drugs, who was also found dead at home. The concentrations of 4-FBF in blood 
were 91 and 112 ng/mL and in urine 200 and 414 ng/mL. The concentrations of 
4-FBF in liver and kidney were 902 and 411 ng/g, and 136 and 197 ng/g, for Case 
1 and Case 2, respectively. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The prevalence of new psychoactive substances (NPS) on the illicit drug market 
continues to grow, with new analogs being routinely synthesized. Routes of 
administration for these compounds are also diversifying, and recent research 
has shown an increase in the incorporation of NPS into vaping liquids. Among the 
most commonly encountered NPS are the cathinone and fentanyl analogs. Fentanyl 
analogs in particular have been implicated in a significant number of deaths, 
usually in combination with other prescription and illicit drugs. We report the 
case of a 44-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse found deceased 
at his home address. Items located within the vicinity of the deceased were 
found to contain furanylfentanyl and 
2-methyl-4'-(methylthio)-2-morpholinopropiophenone (MMMP also known as MTMP, 
MMTMP, Irgacure 907 and Caccure 907). Both of these compounds were detected in 
the post-mortem peripheral blood of the deceased: furanylfentanyl at 1.6 ng/mL 
and MMMP at 6.7 ng/mL. MMMP is an unrestricted, commercially available 
photo-initiator used in the printing and polymer industry, which structurally 
can be classed as a highly modified cathinone. Although MMMP has been found 
previously in drug seizures, this is the first fatality in which MMMP has been 
detected. A number of other prescription and illicit drugs were also detected in 
the blood. MMMP was not detected in the post-mortem urine; however three 
metabolites, beta-hydroxy-MMMP, beta-hydroxy-MMMP-sulfoxide and 
beta-hydroxy-MMMP-sulfone, were presumptively identified. The significance of 
MMMP to the cause of death is uncertain as its pharmacological and toxicological 
profile is unclear.

We report an unusual case of mercury vapor poisoning from using a heated tobacco 
product. The suspect had added grains of mercury into 20 cigarettes in a pack. 
When a 36-year-old Japanese man inserted one of these cigarettes into the 
battery powered holder, it was heated to a temperature of 350 °C, and he inhaled 
vaporized mercury. After using 14 of the cigarettes over 16 h, he noticed he had 
flu-like symptoms so he visited the hospital. Although no physical abnormalities 
were revealed, 99 μg/L of mercury was detected in his serum sample. His general 
condition improved gradually and his whole blood mercury level had decreased to 
38 μg/L 5 days later. When the remaining six cigarettes in the pack were 
examined, many metallic grains weighing a total of 1.57 g were observed. Energy 
dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometry confirmed the grains as elemental 
mercury. Accordingly, the victim was diagnosed with mercury poisoning. Because 
the mercury was incorporated into cigarettes, an unusual and novel intoxication 
occurred through the heating of the tobacco product. Both medical and forensic 
scientific examination confirmed this event as attempted murder.

BACKGROUND: Although thousands of different chemicals have been identified in 
cigarette smoke, the characterization of their urinary metabolites still 
requires significant research. The aim of this work was to perform an untargeted 
metabolomic approach to a pilot cross-sectional study conducted on subjects with 
different smoking habits and to compare the results with those of the targeted 
measurement of mercapturic acids.
METHODS: Urine samples from 67 adults, including 38 non-smokers, 7 electronic 
cigarette users, and 22 traditional tobacco smokers were collected. Samples were 
analysed by liquid chromatography/time-of flight mass spectrometry. Data were 
processed using the R-packages IPO and XCMS to perform feature detection, 
retention time correction and alignment. One-way ANOVA test was used to identify 
different features among groups. Quantitative determination of 17 mercapturic 
acids was available from a previous study.
RESULTS: One hundred and seventeen features, out of 3613, were different among 
groups. They corresponded to 91 potential metabolites, 5 of which were 
identified vs authentic standards, 43 were putatively annotated and 13 were 
attributed to chemical classes. Among identified compounds there were the 
mercapturic acids of acrolein, 1,3-butadiene, and crotonaldehyde; among 
putatively annotated compounds there were the glucuronide conjugated of 
3-hydroxycotinine and the sulfate conjugate of methoxyphenol; with the lowest 
degree of confidence several sulfate conjugates of small molecules were 
annotated. Considering mercapturic acids, the coherence between the targeted and 
untargeted approach was found for a limited number of chemicals, typically the 
most abundant.
CONCLUSIONS: Differences in the urinary levels of several compounds were 
associated to the different smoking habits, suggesting that the proposed 
approach is useful for the investigation of the metabolite patterns related to 
the exposure to toxicants. However, limitations were highlighted, in particular 
regarding the identification of low concentration compounds.

Background Tobacco cigarettes (TCs) increase oxidative stress and inflammation, 
both instigators of atherosclerotic cardiac disease. It is unknown if electronic 
cigarettes (ECs) also increase immune cell oxidative stress. We hypothesized an 
ordered, "dose-response" relationship, with tobacco-product type as "dose" 
(lowest in nonsmokers, intermediate in EC vapers, and highest in TC smokers), 
and the "response" being cellular oxidative stress (COS) in immune cell 
subtypes, in otherwise, healthy young people. Methods and Results Using flow 
cytometry and fluorescent probes, COS was determined in immune cell subtypes in 
33 otherwise healthy young people: nonsmokers (n=12), EC vapers (n=12), and TC 
smokers (n=9). Study groups had similar baseline characteristics, including age, 
sex, race, and education level. A dose-response increase in proinflammatory 
monocytes and lymphocytes, and their COS content among the 3 study groups was 
found: lowest in nonsmokers, intermediate in EC vapers, and highest in TC 
smokers. These findings were most striking in CD14dimCD16+ and CD14++CD16+ 
proinflammatory monocytes and were reproduced with 2 independent fluorescent 
probes of COS. Conclusions These findings portend the development of premature 
cardiovascular disease in otherwise healthy young people who chronically vape 
ECs. On the other hand, that the COS is lower in EC vapers compared with TC 
smokers warrants additional investigation to determine if switching to ECs may 
form part of a harm-reduction strategy. Registration URL:

[Acute poisoning with e-cigarette liquid – case report].

[Article in Polish]

Gomółka E, Radomska M, Bielska DE.

Spreading e-cigarettes popularity comes from relief, the products are safe. They 
don’t contain carcinogenic substances, that are present in tobacco smoke. But 
nicotine present in e-liquid is a very toxic alkaloid, highly addictive. A case 
of acute, oral intoxication with e-liquid was described. A patient, 42-years old 
woman, e-cigarettes addicted, health thus far, by accident drunk a swig of 
e-liquid containing nicotine at concentration 6 mg/ml. At admission to 
Toxicology Department she was conscious, with symptoms: dizziness, flushed 
cheeks, dry skin, dry conjunctivas, medium-wide pupils, nervous twitch, 
tachycardia, elevated blood pressure. Concentration of cotinine – nicotine 
metabolite, in serum and urine were respectively 2077 and 10236 ng/ml. Applied 
treatment was: infusive liquids, intravenous alkalization, administration of 
electrolytes and propranolol. Gradually improvement was reached and on the third 
day of hospitalization, after psychiatric consultation she was 
deinstitutionalized in good medical condition to continue treatment in Neurology 
Clinic. E-fluid intoxications are rare, poisoning course depends on nicotine 
dose, way of absorption, patient’s health state and age.

Heated tobacco products (HTPs) are novel tobacco products that are alternatives 
to cigarettes. The study aimed to investigate the effect of HTPs on blood 
biomarkers of inflammation as well as to provide a comparative evaluation 
between daily heated tobacco users and healthy men who do not use nicotine 
products. This case-control study was carried out among 92 healthy males in 
Poland (Lodz-Province) aged 20-56 years: 44 daily heated tobacco users (daily 
use in the past 90 days) and 48 controls who do not use nicotine products. The 
history of use of the nicotine-containing products was self-reported and 
verified using a saliva cotinine test. A 20 ml blood sample was collected and 
the levels of ten blood biomarkers were analyzed. Among all heated tobacco users 
(n = 44), only the levels of interleukin 8 (IL-8) were significantly higher when 
compared to controls: 6.86 vs. 3.95 (p = 0.01). Among exclusive heated tobacco 
users (n = 33), the levels of IL-8 were also significantly higher when compared 
to controls: 7.76 vs. 3.95 (p = 0.01). IL-8 level was positively correlated 
(r = 0.37; p = 0.01) with the daily number of heated tobacco sticks. Out of 10 
different biomarkers of inflammation, only IL-8 levels were significantly 
elevated in heated tobacco use compared to controls.

The Tobacco Heating System (THS) 2.2, a candidate Modified Risk Tobacco Product 
(MRTP), is designed to heat tobacco without burning it. Tobacco is heated in 
order to reduce the formation of harmful and potentially harmful constituents 
(HPHC), and reduce the consequent exposure, compared with combustible cigarettes 
(CC). In this 5-day exposure, controlled, parallel-group, open-label clinical 
study, 160 smoking, healthy subjects were randomized to three groups and asked 
to: (1) switch from CCs to THS 2.2 (THS group; 80 participants); (2) continue to 
use their own non-menthol CC brand (CC group; 41 participants); or (3) to 
refrain from smoking (smoking abstinence (SA) group; 39 participants). 
Biomarkers of exposure, except those associated with nicotine exposure, were 
significantly reduced in the THS group compared with the CC group, and 
approached the levels observed in the SA group. Increased product consumption 
and total puff volume were reported in the THS group. However, exposure to 
nicotine was similar to CC at the end of the confinement period. Reduction in 
urge-to-smoke was comparable between the THS and CC groups and THS 2.2 product 
was well tolerated.

Nanocomposite microbeads (average diameter = 10-100 µm) were prepared by a 
microemulsion-solidification method and applied to the magnetic solid-phase 
extraction (m-SPE) of fourteen analytes, among pesticides, drugs, and hormones, 
from human urine samples. The microbeads, perfectly spherical in shape to 
maximize the surface contact with the analytes, were composed of magnetic 
nanoparticles dispersed in a polylactic acid (PLA) solid bulk, decorated with 
multi-walled carbon nanotubes (mPLA@MWCNTs). In particular, PLA was recovered 
from filters of smoked electronic cigarettes after an adequate cleaning 
protocol. A complete morphological characterization of the microbeads was 
performed via Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, UV-Vis 
spectroscopy, thermogravimetric and differential scanning calorimetry analysis 
(TGA and DSC), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction analysis 
(XRD). The recovery study of the m-SPE procedure showed yields ≥ 64%, with the 
exception of 4-chloro-2-methylphenol (57%) at the lowest spike level (3 µg L-1). 
The method was validated according to the main FDA guidelines for the validation 
of bioanalytical methods. Using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, 
precision and accuracy were below 11% and 15%, respectively, and detection 
limits of 0.1-1.8 µg L-1. Linearity was studied in the range of interest 1-15 µg 
L-1 with determination coefficients greater than 0.99. In light of the obtained 
results, the nanocomposite microbeads have proved to be a valid and sustainable 
alternative to traditional sorbents, offering good analytical standards and 
being synthetized from recycled plastic material. One of the main objectives of 
the current work is to provide an innovative and optimized procedure for the 
recycling of a plastic waste, to obtain a regular and reliable microstructure, 
whose application is here presented in the field of analytical chemistry. The 
simplicity and greenness of the method endows the procedure with a versatile 
applicability in different research and industrial fields.

Exposure to secondhand smoke (SHSe) can compound an already challenging set of 
health problems for youth with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD). Exposure to electronic 
cigarettes may also impact SCD symptomology and respiratory functioning. This 
study built on these previous findings by a) utilizing two objective measures of 
SHSe, salivary cotinine and exhaled carbon monoxide and b) examining the 
association of SHSe with emergency department utilization, physician-reported 
sickle cell crises, and pulmonary functioning. Caregivers (N = 31 dyads; 
Mage = 37.6 years; SD = 8.5 years) of youth with SCD (Mage = 9.0 years; 
SD = 4.5 years) completed self-report measures of tobacco/nicotine use. Youth 
provided a saliva sample to assess cotinine levels, and performed pulmonary 
function tests. Dyads provided breath samples for measurement of eCO. A chart 
review was conducted to obtain medical history and utilization. Majority of 
youth (88%) were exposed to SHS via salivary cotinine. Interestingly, no 
significant associations were observed between youth cotinine levels and 
emergency department utilization, physician-reported sickle cell crises, or 
pulmonary functioning. Present findings indicate a need to assess for SHSe using 
objective assessment measures. Future research should investigate which specific 
factors contribute to increase SHSe/SHVe in youth with SCD.

Heated tobacco products (HTPs) are expected to have the potential to reduce 
risks of smoking-associated cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, 
mechanism-based investigations of the effect of HTPs on atherosclerosis remain 
insufficient and further studies under human-relevant situations are desired for 
deeper understanding of the reduced risk potential of HTPs. In this study, we 
first developed an in vitro model of monocyte adhesion by considering 
macrophage-derived proinflammatory cytokine-mediated endothelial activation 
using an organ-on-a-chip (OoC), which provided great opportunities to mimic 
major aspects of human physiology. Then biological activities of aerosol from 
three different types of HTPs in terms of monocyte adhesion were compared with 
that of cigarette smoke (CS). Our model showed that the effective concentration 
ranges of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) were close 
to the actual condition in CVD pathogenesis. The model also showed that monocyte 
adhesion was less induced by each HTP aerosol than CS, which may be caused by 
less proinflammatory cytokine secretion. In summary, our vasculature-on-a-chip 
model assessed the difference in biological effects between cigarettes and HTPs, 
and suggested a reduced risk potential of HTPs for atherosclerosis.

Acute changes in select physiological parameters associated with cardiovascular 
physiology (systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR)), 
pulmonary function (FVC, FEV1, and exhaled CO and NO) and adverse events were 
measured in 105 clinically confined subjects who were randomized into groups 
that either completely or partially switched from conventional cigarettes to 
e-cigarettes or completely discontinued using tobacco and nicotine products 
altogether. Use of the e-cigarettes for five days under the various study 
conditions did not lead to higher BP or HR values, negative respiratory health 
outcomes or serious adverse health events. Reductions in BP and HR vital signs 
were observed in most of the participants that either ceased tobacco and 
nicotine products use altogether or switched completely to using e-cigarettes. 
Pulmonary function tests showed small but non-statistically significant 
improvements in FVC and FEV1 measurements in most use groups. Statistically 
significant (p < 0.05) benefits associated with smoking reduction were also 
noted in exhaled CO and NO levels. All study products were well tolerated. The 
study findings suggest that there are potential cardiovascular and pulmonary 
function benefits when smokers switch to using e-cigarette products. This 
further reinforces the potential that e-cigarettes offer smokers seeking an 
alternative to conventional tobacco products.

Bromelain-based enzymatic debridement of e-cigarette burns: a single unit 
experience.

OBJECTIVE: It is widely accepted that the early debridement of burns improves 
outcome. There is increasing evidence that enzymatic debridement is an effective 
technique for removal of full-thickness and deep-dermal burns, reducing blood 
loss and often the need for autologous skin grafting by avoiding over excision 
of the burn. We aim to highlight the potential use of this form of debridement 
as an alternative to surgical management in patients with electronic cigarette 
(e-cigarette)-associated flame burn injuries.
METHODS: This case series presents the use of Nexobrid (MediWound Ltd, Israel), 
a non-surgical, bromelain-based enzymatic debridement technique, in patients 
with deep partial-thickness burns (range: 1-3% total body surface area), 
avoiding the need for autologous skin grafting.
RESULTS: Burn wounds in two patients healed within 14 days without complications 
or the need for further surgical intervention. Another patient required further 
dressings after discharge but failed to attend follow-up appointments. These 
results are comparable with those reported by others using conservative 
management of e-cigarette burns.
CONCLUSION: The authors wish to raise awareness of the potential for a 
combination of thermal and chemical burns related to e-cigarette explosions. 
Chemical burns should be excluded by pH testing of the burn wound. From our 
experience, small e-cigarette-associated flame burns can be considered for 
management with enzymatic debridement.

The health consequences associated with using electronic cigarettes (ECs) are of 
great public interest because of their potential role in smoking cessation. In 
110 participants, including 41 nonusers, 34 people who exclusively use ECs (EC 
group), and 35 people who smoke tobacco cigarettes (TCs) including 12 dual users 
(collectively called the TC-D group), the heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), 
and heart rate variability (HRV) were compared at baseline. People in the EC or 
the TC-D groups were also compared after using a 4th generation EC with or 
without nicotine, a TC with or without nicotine (TC-D group only), and a 
straw-control. Baseline HR, BP, and HRV parameters were not different among the 
EC, the TC-D, and nonuser groups. In people who exclusively use ECs, acute 
nicotine-EC use increased HR and BP, and produced changes in HRV patterns 
suggestive of increased cardiac sympathetic influence. In people in the TC-D 
group, BP increased similarly after acutely smoking a nicotine-TC or a 
nicotine-EC. However, the increase in HR was significantly greater after smoking 
a TC compared with the nicotine-EC despite similar acute increases in plasma 
nicotine. Overall, all exposures containing nicotine significantly increased HR 
and BP in both cohorts when compared with non-nicotine exposures. Since acute EC 
use 1) produces an abnormal HRV pattern associated with increased cardiac 
sympathetic tone in people who chronically use ECs, and 2) similar hemodynamic 
increases compared with acute TC smoking in people who chronically smoke TCs 
including dual users, the role of ECs as part of a harm reduction strategy is 
questioned.NEW & NOTEWORTHY We found that nicotine, not the non-nicotine 
constituents in tobacco cigarette (TC) or electronic cigarette (EC) emissions, 
may be the instigator of the acute, potentially adverse, changes in hemodynamics 
and heart rate variability (HRV) that were recorded several minutes after 
tobacco product use. Furthermore, acute EC use produced an abnormal HRV pattern 
associated with increased cardiac risk in people who chronically smoke ECs and 
produced similar hemodynamic increases compared with acute TC use in people who 
chronically smoke TCs, including people who are dual users.

Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are becoming the fashionable alternative to 
decrease tobacco smoking, although their impact on health has not been fully 
assessed yet. The present study was designed to compare the impact of 
e-cigarette refill liquid (e-liquid) without nicotine to e-liquid with nicotine 
on rat testis. For this purpose, e-liquid with nicotine and e-liquid without 
nicotine (0.5 mg/kg of body weight) were administered to adult male Wistar rats 
via the intraperitoneally route during four weeks. Results showed that e-liquid 
with or without nicotine leads to diminished sperm density and viability, such 
as a decrease in testicular lactate dehydrogenase activity and testosterone 
level. Furthermore, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) 
analysis identified a reduction in cytochrome P450 side-chain cleavage (P450 
scc) and 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17βHSD) mRNA level, two key 
enzymes of steroidogenesis. Following e-liquid exposure, histopathological 
examination showed alterations in testis tissue marked by germ cells 
desquamation, disorganization of the tubular contents of testis and cell 
deposits in seminiferous tubules. Finally, analysis of oxidative stress status 
pointed an outbreak of antioxidant enzyme activities such as superoxide 
dismutase, catalase and gluthatione-S-transferase, as well as an important 
increase in sulfhydril group content. Taken together, these results indicate 
that e-liquid per se induces toxicity in Wistar rat testis, similar to e-liquid 
with nicotine, by disrupting oxidative balance and steroidogenesis.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Heated tobacco products (HTPs) are novel alternative 
tobacco products being promoted as an alternative to cigarettes. To evaluate the 
impact of HTP use on vascular function, we investigated the effects of a brief 
HTP usage on arterial stiffness and platelet thrombus formation in healthy 
volunteers.
METHODS: In a randomised crossover study, twenty-four healthy young adults with 
occasional tobacco use smoked the HTP IQOS 3 Multi (Phillip Morris Int.) and 
"no-exposure" was used as a control, with a wash-out period of at least one week 
in-between. Arterial stiffness was assessed through pulse wave velocity and 
pulse wave analysis. Blood samples, collected at baseline and 5 min following 
exposure, were analysed with the Total-Thrombus-formation analysis system 
evaluating platelet and fibrin-rich thrombus formation tendency.
RESULTS: HTP exposure caused immediate heightened pulse wave velocity 
(+0.365 m/s, 95% CI: +0.188 to 0.543; p = 0.004) and enhanced augmentation index 
corrected to heart rate (+6.22%, 95% CI: +2.33 to 10.11; p = 0.003) compared to 
the no-exposure occasion. Similarly, blood pressure and heart rate transiently 
increased immediately following HTP inhalation. Platelet thrombus formation 
significantly increased following HTP exposure (area under the curve +59.5, 95% 
CI: +25.6 to 93.4; p < 0.001) compared to no-exposure. No effect was seen on 
fibrin-rich thrombus formation following HTP-exposure.
CONCLUSIONS: Brief HTP use in healthy young adults had immediate adverse effects 
on vascular function resulting in increased arterial stiffness and platelet 
thrombus formation, known risk factors for the development of atherosclerosis. 
Further research is needed to address long term health impacts.

Incidents of strokes are increased in young women relative to young men, 
suggesting that oral contraceptive (OC) use is one of the causes of stroke among 
young women. Long-term exposures to the varying combinations of estrogen and 
progestogen found in OCs affect blood clotting, lipid and lipoprotein 
metabolism, endothelial function, and de novo synthesis of neurosteroids, 
especially brain-derived 17β-estradiol. The latter is essential for 
neuroprotection, memory, sexual differentiation, synaptic transmission, and 
behavior. Deleterious effects of OCs may be exacerbated due to comorbidities 
like polycystic ovary syndrome, sickle cell anemia, COVID-19, exposures to 
endocrine disrupting chemicals, and conventional or electronic cigarette 
smoking. The goal of the current review is to revisit the available literature 
regarding the impact of OC use on stroke, to explain possible underlying 
mechanisms, and to identify gaps in our understanding to promote future research 
to reduce and cure stroke in OC users.

70-year-old male patient with BMI 22.1 kg/m(2) who successfully underwent 
transumbilical single-incision plus 1 port robotic total mesorectal resection of 
upper rectal cancer at the General Surgery Department of Daping Hospital of Army 
Military Medical University on September 18, 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. 
Preoperative colonoscopy revealed that the distance of upper rectal cancer to 
anal edge was 14 cm, and the tumor size was 2.5 cm×1.5 cm×1 cm. Pathological 
result confirmed rectal moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. The 
preoperative abdominal CT showed thickened bowel-wall of upper rectum and the 
blurred perirectal fat, suggesting tumor infiltration. Results: The operation 
was successful. There were no conversion to laparotomy or abdominal auxiliary 
incision, and the mesorectum of the specimen was intact. The operation time was 
165 minutes, the blood loss was about 20 ml, and there were no complications 
such as injury to peripheral organs. Postoperative pathology showed ulcerative 
moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the upper rectum with TNM stage IVA 
(T4N2b). The postoperative recovery was smooth. Patient ambulated on the 1st 
day, the catheter was removed on the 7th day, and discharged from the hospital 
on the 8th day. Conclusion: The transumbilical SIPOP robotic total mesorectal 
excision is safe, effective and feasible.

Smoking is considered an important source for inorganic elements, most of them 
toxic for human health. During the last years, there has been a significant 
increase in the use of e-cigarettes, although the role of them as source of 
inorganic elements has not been well established. A cross-sectional study 
including a total of 150 subjects from Brasov (Romania), divided into three 
groups (non-smokers, cigarette smokers and electronic cigarettes smokers) were 
recruited to disclose the role of smoking on the human exposure to inorganic 
elements. Concentration of 42 elements, including trace elements, elements in 
the ATSDR's priority pollutant list and rare earth elements (REE) were measured 
by ICP-MS in the blood serum of participants. Cigarette smokers showed the 
highest levels of copper, molybdenum, zinc, antimony, and strontium. Electronic 
cigarette (e-cigarette) users presented the highest concentrations of selenium, 
silver, and vanadium. Beryllium, europium and lanthanides were detected more 
frequently among e-cigarette users (20.6%, 23.5%, and 14.7%) than in cigarette 
smokers (1.7%, 19.0%, and 12.1%, respectively); and the number of detected REE 
was also higher among e-cigarette users (11.8% of them showed more than 10 
different elements). Serum levels of cerium and erbium increased as the duration 
of the use of e-cigarettes was longer. We have found that smoking is mainly a 
source of heavy metals while the use of e-cigarettes is a potential source of 
REE. However, these elements were detected at low concentrations.

AIM: A feasibility/acceptability trial was undertaken at Ward 5, Kenepuru 
Hospital, Porirua, to ascertain whether electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) 
were a useful option to replace or reduce smoking in the detoxification ward.
METHODS: Two groups of patients were studied. Tobacco use and dependency data 
were collected for each. The first group was surveyed on the usefulness of 
standard nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). The second group were offered 
e-cigarettes with the option of standard NRT as well. All were asked to record 
their use of cigarettes, e-cigarettes and NRT during their stay on the ward, and 
to comment on their experiences. Outcomes monitored were self-reported use of 
NRT and of tobacco. Informal impressions of the nursing staff were also 
collected, where offered. For the e-cigarette group, a blood sample was taken on 
day 3 or 4 of their stay in hospital for nicotine/cotinine analysis, to confirm 
nicotine intake status.
RESULTS: E-cigarettes were well tolerated as a form of nicotine replacement, 
eliciting positive comments, though they were not effective for all. The average 
reduction in median cigarettes per day was very similar between the group given 
standard NRT and the e-cigarette group, at 80% and 86% respectively. There were 
no adverse effects reported.
CONCLUSION: The study showed that e-cigarettes were an acceptable form of 
nicotine replacement for these alcohol-dependent patients during their time in 
the ward. For heavily tobacco-dependent smokers, e-cigarettes may provide a 
useful aid to patient management within a hospital setting.

BACKGROUND: Many smokers report attempting to quit each year, yet most relapse, 
in part due to exposure to smoking-related cues. It is hypothesized that 
extinction of the cue-drug association could be facilitated through random 
nicotine delivery (RND), thus making it easier for smokers to quit. The current 
study aimed to evaluate the effects of RND on smoking cessation-related outcomes 
including cigarettes per day (CPD) and exhaled carbon monoxide (CO).
METHODS: Participants were current smokers (>9 CPD) interested in quitting. 
Novel trans-mucosal, orally dissolving nicotine films, developed by Bionex 
Pharmaceuticals, were used in the study. The pharmacokinetic profile of these 
films was assessed in single (Experiment 1) and multiple-dose (Experiment 2) 
administrations prior to the smoking cessation study (Experiment 3). In 
Experiment 3, participants were randomized 1:1:1 to recieve 4 nicotine films per 
day of either: placebo delivery (0 mg), steady-state delivery (2 mg), or random 
nicotine delivery (RND) (0 mg or 4 mg). After two weeks, participants were 
advised to quit (target quit date, TQD) and were followed up 4 weeks later to 
collect CPD and CO and to measure dependence (Penn State Cigarette Dependence 
Index; PSCDI) and craving (Questionnaire of Smoking Urges; QSU-Brief). Means and 
frequencies were used to describe the data and repeated measures ANOVA was used 
to determine differences between groups.
RESULTS: The pharmacokinetic studies (Experiment 1 and 2) demonstrated that the 
films designed for this study delivered nicotine as expected, with the 4 mg film 
delivering a nicotine boost of approximately 12.4 ng/mL across both the single 
and the multiple dose administration studies. The films reduced craving for a 
cigarette and were well-tolerated, overall, and caused no changes in blood 
pressure or heart rate. Using these films in the cessation study (Experiment 3) 
(n = 45), there was a significant overall reduction in cigarettes smoked per day 
(CPD) and in exhaled CO, with no significant differences across groups (placebo, 
steady-state, RND). In addition, there were no group differences in dependence 
or craving. Adverse events included heartburn, hiccups, nausea, and to a lesser 
extent, vomiting and anxiety and there were no differences across groups.
CONCLUSION: Overall, this pilot study found that RND via orally dissolving films 
was feasible and well tolerated by participants. However, RND participants did 
not experience a greater reduction in self-reported CPD and exhaled CO, compared 
with participants in the steady-state and placebo delivery groups. Future 
studies to evaluate optimal RND parameters with larger sample sizes are needed 
to fully understand the effect of RND on smoking cessation-related outcomes.

E-cigarettes containing 'nicotine salts' aim to increase smoker's satisfaction 
by improving blood nicotine delivery and other sensory properties. Here, we 
evaluated the pharmacokinetic profiles and subjective effects of nicotine from 
two e-cigarette device platforms with varying concentrations of nicotine lactate 
(nicotine salt) e-liquid relative to conventional cigarettes. A randomised, 
open-label, cross-over clinical study was conducted in 15 healthy US adult 
smokers. Five different e-cigarette products were evaluated consecutively on 
different days after use of own brand conventional cigarette. Plasma nicotine 
pharmacokinetics, subjective effects, and tolerability were assessed following 
controlled use of the products. The rate of nicotine absorption into the 
bloodstream was comparable from all e-cigarettes tested and was as rapid as that 
for conventional cigarette. However, in all cases, nicotine delivery did not 
exceed that of the conventional cigarette. The pharmacokinetic profiles of 
nicotine salt emissions were also dependent upon the properties of the 
e-cigarette device. Subjective scores were numerically highest after smoking a 
conventional cigarette followed by the myblu 40-mg nicotine salt formulation. 
The rise in nicotine blood levels following use of all the tested e-cigarettes 
was quantified as 'a little' to 'modestly' satisfying at relieving the desire to 
smoke. All products were well tolerated with no notable adverse events reported. 
These results demonstrate that, while delivering less nicotine than a 
conventional cigarette, the use of nicotine salts in e-cigarettes enables 
cigarette-like pulmonary delivery of nicotine that reduces desire to smoke.

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of adults between 18 and 55 years 
old. Inclusion criteria were: exclusive e-cigarette use or cigarette smoking for 
≥ 1 year or no history of tobacco use. Participants with a history of pulmonary 
illness, atopy, medications (except birth control pills), marijuana, and illegal 
substance use were excluded. Custom Multiplex ELISA was used to measure YKL-40 
and other biomarker levels in the serum and induced sputum of the participants. 
Multivariable linear regression was used to compare the levels of YLK-40 in 
healthy participants, e-cigarette, and cigarette users after adjusting for age, 
sex, and BMI.
RESULTS: We recruited 20 healthy controls, 23 cigarette smokers, and 22 
exclusive e-cigarette users. Serum YKL-40 (ng/ml) was significantly higher in 
e-cigarette users (Median 21.2 [IQR 12.1-24.0] ng/ml) when compared to controls 
(12.2 [IQR 8.7-18.1] ng/ml, p = 0.016) but comparable to cigarette smokers (21.6 
[IQR 11.62-51.7] ng/ml, p = 0.31). No significant differences were found in the 
serum or sputum of the other biomarkers tested.
CONCLUSION: The inflammatory biomarker, YKL-40 is elevated in the serum but not 
the sputum of e-cigarette users with no reported pulmonary disease. Further 
research is necessary to characterize this association.

RATIONALE: The degree to which the EU version of Juul with 20 mg/ml nicotine 
(Juul EU) delivers nicotine to users is likely to determine its treatment 
potential.
OBJECTIVES: To compare the pharmacokinetic profile and user ratings of Juul EU, 
Juul US (59 mg/ml nicotine), cigarettes and other e-cigarette (EC) products.
METHODS: In a within-subjects crossover design, 18 vapers used, at separate 
sessions, their own brand cigarette (OBC), Juul US and Juul EU for 5 min ad 
libitum, after overnight abstinence. Seven of the participants also tested eight 
other EC previously. Blood samples were taken at baseline and 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 
30 min after initiating product use. Products were rated on a range of 
characteristics.
RESULTS: Juul EU delivered less nicotine than OBC (t(13) = -4.64 p < .001) and 
than Juul US (t(13) = -6.40, p < .001): AUC0 ≥ 30 77.3, 324.8 and 355.9, 
respectively. Maximum nicotine concentration (Cmax) was also much lower for Juul 
EU than Juul US (z = -3.59, p < .001): Cmax 3.8 ng/ml vs 21.1 ng/ml, 
respectively. Juul EU was perceived to relieve urges to smoke less than Juul US 
(z = -2.29, p = .022) and to provide less nicotine (z = -2.57. p = 0.010). Juul 
EU delivered less nicotine than refillable EC (Cmax: t(6) = 3.02, p = 0.023; 
AUC0 ≥ 30: z = -2.20, p = 0.028) and also less than cig-a-like EC, though the 
difference did not reach significance (Cmax: t(6) = 2.49, p = 0.047; AUC0 ≥ 30: 
z = -1.99, p = 0.046). Subjective ratings of Juul EU and other EC products were 
similar.
CONCLUSIONS: Juul EU delivers much less nicotine to users than Juul US, and also 
less than refillable EC products. It may thus have more limited potential to 
help smokers quit.

Using the BMD Approach to Derive Acceptable Daily Intakes of Cannabidiol (CBD) 
and Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) Relevant to Electronic Cigarette Liquids.

BACKGROUND: In the past 60 years, Cannabis sativa L. has been an object of 
increasing interest because of the psychotropic effects of some of its 
constituents. These effects mainly arise from the cannabinoid 
Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC). C. sativa species also synthesize and 
accumulate the non-psychotropic compound cannabidiol (CBD). Due to their 
therapeutic potential, both cannabinoids are an object of medical research and 
drug development. More recently, CBD has received increasing interest as an 
ingredient in electronic cigarette liquids (e-liquids). This trend may have been 
reinforced by health and disease-related claims, often based on clinical 
studies, which are used to advertise CBD. CBD liquids may be based on 
full-spectrum hemp extracts, CBD isolates, or synthetic CBD, all of which may 
contain some residual levels of Δ9-THC from either natural content (in the 
extracts) or from possible degradation of CBD to Δ9-THC, which may occur during 
storage. There is uncertainty about safety regarding the consumption of CBD (and 
Δ9-THC) in e-liquids. The aim of this publication was to present an approach for 
a toxicological risk assessment of CBD and Δ9-THC relevant to e-liquids by using 
the benchmark dose (BMD) approach.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Before an analysis to estimate a reference dose (RfD) for 
both cannabinoids, a systematic review of dose-response data was conducted. The 
data obtained were analyzed using the BMD approach to derive a benchmark dose 
lower confidence limit (BMDL). The BMDL was used as a point of departure to 
estimate the RfD.
RESULTS: No adequate human data suitable for dose-response modeling were 
identified. Based on animal data, the RfD values for the most sensitive 
endpoints were selected. For CBD, an RfD for acute exposure of 1 mg/kg body 
weight (bw) was estimated. For Δ9-THC, an acute RfD was found to be 0.006 mg/kg 
bw. Additionally, the RfD for chronic exposure to CBD was estimated to be 4 
mg/kg bw per day. The respective endpoints for CBD were a reduction in 
norepinephrine turnover and a reduction in uterus weight. The endpoint for 
Δ9-THC was a change in blood pressure.
CONCLUSIONS: Because of the limited availability and quality of dose-response 
data, it cannot be excluded that the estimated RfD values might be afflicted 
with considerable uncertainties. Therefore, it is recommended to conduct further 
research on dose-response data, preferably from human studies.

STUDY QUESTION: Are use of e-cigarettes and snuff associated with testicular 
function as previously shown for conventional cigarettes and marijuana?
SUMMARY ANSWER: Use of e-cigarettes is associated with reduced semen quality but 
not with higher serum testosterone level as observed for conventional cigarette 
use. Snuff use was not associated with markers of testicular function.
WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Cigarette smoking has previously been associated with 
higher testosterone levels and impaired semen quality, whereas it is unresolved 
whether use of e-cigarettes or snuff influence the testicular function.
STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This cross-sectional population-based study 
included 2008 men with information on cigarette and marijuana use (enrolled 
between 2012 and 2018), among whom 1221 men also had information on e-cigarette 
and snuff use (enrolled between 2015 and 2018).
PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Men (median age 19.0 years) from the 
general population provided a semen and blood sample and filled out a 
questionnaire on lifestyle including information on smoking behaviour. 
Associations between different types of smoking (e-cigarettes, snuff, marijuana 
and cigarettes) and reproductive hormones (total and free testosterone, sex 
hormone-binding globulin, LH, oestradiol and ratios of inhibin B/FSH, 
testosterone/LH and free testosterone/LH) and semen parameters (total sperm 
count and sperm concentration) were examined using multiple linear regression 
analyses adjusted for relevant confounders.
MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Approximately half of the men (52%) were 
cigarette smokers, 13% used e-cigarettes, 25% used snuff and 33% used marijuana. 
Users of e-cigarettes and marijuana were often also cigarette smokers. Compared 
to non-users, daily e-cigarette users had significantly lower total sperm count 
(147 million vs 91 million) as did daily cigarette smokers (139 million vs 103 
million), in adjusted analyses. Furthermore, significantly higher total and free 
testosterone levels were seen in cigarette smoking men (6.2% and 4.1% higher 
total testosterone and 6.2% and 6.2% higher free testosterone in daily smokers 
and occasional smokers, respectively, compared to non-smoking men), but not 
among e-cigarette users. Daily users of marijuana had 8.3% higher total 
testosterone levels compared to non-users. No associations were observed for 
snuff in relation to markers of testicular function.
LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: We cannot exclude that our results can be 
influenced by residual confounding by behavioural factors not adjusted for. The 
number of daily e-cigarette users was limited and findings should be replicated 
in other studies.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: This is the first human study to indicate 
that not only cigarette smoking but also use of e-cigarettes is associated with 
lower sperm counts. This could be important knowledge for men trying to achieve 
a pregnancy, as e-cigarettes are often considered to be less harmful than 
conventional cigarette smoking.

AIM: To describe systemic nicotine exposure and subjective effects of electronic 
cigarettes (e-cigarettes) in people who use both e-cigarettes and cigarettes 
(dual users), including within-subject comparisons of e-cigarette and cigarette 
use.
DESIGN: Two-arm, counterbalanced cross-over study. Participants used their usual 
brand of e-cigarette or cigarette during a standardized session in a 2-week 
study.
SETTING: Hospital research ward, San Francisco, CA, USA.
PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-six healthy (eight women, 28 men) participants.
MEASUREMENTS: Plasma nicotine was analyzed by gas chromatography-tandem mass 
spectrometry; nicotine withdrawal, urge to smoke and vape, affective states, 
craving, satisfaction and psychological reward were measured by standardized 
questionnaires.
FINDINGS: Compared with cigarettes, average maximum plasma nicotine 
concentration (Cmax ) was lower with e-cigarettes [6.1 ± 5.5 ng/ml, mean 
± standard deviation (SD) versus 20.2 ± 11.1 ng/ml, P < 0.001] and time of 
maximal concentration (Tmax ) was longer (6.5 ± 5.4 versus 2.7 ± 2.4 minutes, 
P < 0.001). Use of both products resulted in a reduction in the severity of 
withdrawal symptoms, negative affect and urge to use either product. 
E-cigarettes were less rewarding and satisfying and reduced craving to a lesser 
degree than cigarettes. We were not able to detect any differences in withdrawal 
symptoms, affective states and urge to smoke cigarettes between e-cigarette and 
cigarette use.
CONCLUSION: Systemic nicotine exposure was, on average, lower with single use of 
e-cigarettes compared with cigarettes, and e-cigarettes were judged to be less 
satisfying and rewarding and reduced craving less than cigarettes.

Abuse liability (AL) of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) is relevant 
as the category increases in popularity as a potentially less-harmful 
alternative to cigarette smoking. AL assessments are important to the FDA in 
determining if a new product is appropriate for the protection of public health. 
This paper reports the results for Vuse Solo (G2 cartridge design) compared to 
high and low AL-comparators evaluated in an open-label, randomized crossover 
confinement AL study. The confinement design was adapted from previous 
ambulatory studies of Vuse Solo (G1 cartridge design) and included product 
familiarization sessions before each four-hour test session in which subjective 
measures, nicotine pharmacokinetics (PK), and physiological endpoints were 
assessed following a single 10-min ad libitum product use session. Product 
liking, intent to use again, suppression of urge to smoke, and nicotine PK were 
lower after use of Vuse Solo compared to cigarettes and higher after use of Vuse 
Solo compared to nicotine gum. No significant differences in blood pressure or 
heart rate were observed between the products pre- to post-product use. These 
data reinforce previous research and provide the scientific evidence to support 
regulatory decisions demonstrating that Vuse Solo has an AL profile lower than 
that of combustible cigarettes but higher than that of nicotine gum and, 
therefore, may be a suitable replacement for cigarette smoking for some adult 
smokers.

INTRODUCTION: The Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study is a 
nationally representative cohort of tobacco product users and nonusers. The 
study's main purpose is to obtain longitudinal epidemiologic data on tobacco use 
and exposure among the US population.
AIMS AND METHODS: Nicotine biomarkers-cotinine (COT) and 
trans-3'-hydroxycotinine (HCT)-were measured in blood samples collected from 
adult daily tobacco users and nonusers during Wave 1 of the PATH Study 
(2013-2014; n = 5012; one sample per participant). Participants' tobacco product 
use and exposure to secondhand smoke were categorized based on questionnaire 
responses. Nonusers were subdivided into never users and recent former users. 
Daily tobacco users were classified into seven tobacco product use categories: 
exclusive users of cigarette, smokeless tobacco, electronic cigarette, cigar, 
pipe, and hookah, as well as polyusers. We calculated sample-weighted geometric 
mean (GM) concentrations of cotinine, HCT, and the nicotine metabolite ratio 
(NMR) and evaluated their associations with tobacco use with adjustment for 
potential confounders.
RESULTS: The GMs (95% confidence intervals) of COT and HCT concentrations for 
daily tobacco users were 196 (184 to 208) and 72.5 (67.8 to 77.4) ng/mL, and for 
nonusers they were 0.033 (0.028 to 0.037) and 0.021 (0.018 to 0.023) ng/mL. 
Exclusive smokeless tobacco users had the highest COT concentrations of all user 
groups examined. The GM NMR in daily users was 0.339 (95% confidence interval: 
0.330 to 0.350).
CONCLUSIONS: These nationally representative estimates of serum nicotine 
biomarkers could be the basis for reference ranges characterizing nicotine 
exposure for daily tobacco users and nonusers in the US adult population.
IMPLICATIONS: This report summarizes the serum nicotine biomarker measurements 
in Wave 1 of the PATH Study. We are reporting the first estimates of HCT in 
serum for daily tobacco users and nonusers in the noninstitutionalized, civilian 
US adult population; the first nationally representative serum COT estimates for 
daily exclusive users of different tobacco products and daily polyusers; and the 
first nationally representative estimate of the serum NMR in daily tobacco users 
by age, race/ethnicity, and sex.

(J.L.C.).

BACKGROUND: Chronic electronic-cigarette (EC) use is reported to decrease 
vascular endothelial function. However, the mechanism(s) mediating this 
reduction remain unclear. In this study, we examined endothelium- and 
NO-dependent dilation, and the role of oxidative stress in attenuating these 
responses, in healthy young EC users (n=20, 10 males/10 females) compared with 
healthy controls (n=20, 10 males/10 females). We hypothesized that EC would have 
reduced endothelium- and NO-dependent dilation and administration of the 
superoxide scavenger tempol would increase these responses in EC. We further 
hypothesized that female EC would have the greatest reductions in endothelium- 
and NO-dependent dilation.
METHODS: We assessed microvascular endothelium-dependent vasodilator function in 
vivo by measurement of cutaneous vascular conductance (%CVCmax) responses to a 
standardized local heating protocol in control and 10 μM tempol-treated sites. 
After full expression of the local heating response, 15 mM NG-nitro-L-arginine 
methyl ester (NO synthase inhibition) was perfused.
RESULTS: EC had significantly reduced endothelium- (73±15 versus 87±9%CVCmax; 
P<0.001) and NO-dependent (48±17% versus 62±15%; P=0.011) dilation. Tempol 
perfusion increased endothelium-dependent (84±12%CVCmax P=0.01) and NO-dependent 
(63±14% P=0.005) dilation in EC but had no effect in healthy control. Within 
female sex, EC had lower endothelium-dependent (71±13 versus 89±7%CVCmax; 
P=0.002) and NO-dependent (50±6 versus 69±11%; P=0.005) dilation compared with 
healthy control, and tempol augmented endothelium-dependent (83±13%CVCmax; 
P=0.002) and NO-dependent (62±13%; P=0.015) dilation. There were no group or 
treatment differences within male sex.
CONCLUSION: Healthy young adult EC users have reduced microvascular 
endothelium-dependent and NO-dependent dilation, driven by greater reductions in 
female EC users, and mediated in part by superoxide.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The use of electronic cigarettes is increasing dramatically 
on a global scale and its effects on human health remain uncertain. In the 
present study, we measured endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and microvesicles 
(MVs) in healthy young volunteers following short-term exposure to inhalation of 
e-cigarette vapor (ECV) to determine vascular changes.
METHODS: Sixteen healthy seldom smokers were randomized into two groups either 
exposed or not exposed to 10 puffs of ECV for 10 min, in a crossover design. 
Blood samples were obtained at baseline and 1, 4 and 24 h following exposure. 
EPCs (CD34 + CD309) and MVs were analyzed by flow cytometry. MVs were phenotyped 
according to origin (platelet (CD41), endothelial (CD144), leukocytes (CD45), 
monocytes (CD14)) and nuclear content (SYTO 13 dye). In addition, expression of 
inflammation markers such P-selectin (CD62P), E-selectin (CD62E), CD40-ligand 
(CD154) and HMGB1 was investigated. Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) was 
also measured at baseline and after 24 h.
RESULTS: EPC levels in blood were significantly increased 1 h following exposure 
to ECV and returned to baseline values after 24 h. Only E-selectin positive MVs 
(endothelial origin) were slightly elevated (p < 0.038). FeNO was unaffected by 
exposure to ECV.
CONCLUSIONS: In healthy volunteers, ten puffs of e-cigarette vapor inhalation 
caused an increase in EPCs. This increase was of the same magnitude as following 
smoking of one traditional cigarette, as we previously demonstrated. Taken 
together, these results may represent signs of possible vascular changes after 
short e-cigarette inhalation. Further studies analyzing potential cardiovascular 
health effects are critical as the e-cigarette market continues to burgeon.

Influence of inhaled nicotine source on arterial stiffness.

Szołtysek-Bołdys I, Sobczak A, Zielińska-Danch W, Bartoń A, Koszowski B, 
Kośmider L.

INTRODUCTION: Tobacco smoking leads to changes in hemodynamic parameters such as 
heart rate and systolic or diastolic blood pressure. It has a direct influence 
on the elasticity of blood vessels and increases arterial stiffness, which can 
result in development of atherosclerosis. Data show that the nicotine in tobacco 
smoke probably is responsible for these changes. Electronic cigarettes 
(e-cigarettes) were supposedly a healthier alternative to combustible cigarettes 
because they imitate a process of cigarettes smoking but generate nicotine 
aerosol without the toxic substances from tobacco combustion. However, the use 
of e-cigarettes is still controversial because their toxicity, safety and long 
term use health impact have not been sufficiently studied.
AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in arterial stiffness 
parameters after smoking a cigarette or e-cigarette use.
METHODS: Fifteen healthy women, aged 19-25 years old, smoking ≥5 cigarettes per 
day for at least two years participated in the study. A non-invasive measurement 
of arterial stiffness parameters - Stiffness Index (SI) and Reflection Index 
(RI) - was conducted and systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate 
were measured before and after smoking a conventional cigarette as well as use 
of an e-cigarette.
RESULTS: Statistically significant changes in the SI and RI were observed before 
and after smoking of a conventional cigarette [SI: 6.75m/s (6.66 - 6.85, 95% CI) 
vs 6.56m/s (6.46 - 6.65. 95% CI), p=0.0056; RI: 54.0% (51.5 - 56.7, 95% CI) vs 
49.6% (47.5 - 51.8, 95% CI), p=0.010]. The use of e-cigarettes resulted in no 
statistically significant changes in the SI and RI. After both product use 
systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate increased but the changes 
were not statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to conventional cigarette use, the use of electronic 
cigarettes causes no changes in arterial stiffness. This may indicate lower 
bioavailability of nicotine from the e-cigarette or an additional effect of 
other substances present in cigarette smoke but absent in an e-cigarette 
aerosol.

An Open-Label, Randomized, Controlled, Crossover Study to Assess Nicotine 
Pharmacokinetics and Subjective Effects of the JUUL System with Three Nicotine 
Concentrations Relative to Combustible Cigarettes in Adult Smokers.

INTRODUCTION: This randomized, open-label, crossover clinical study evaluated 
nicotine pharmacokinetics (PK) and subjective effects of the JUUL System (JS; 
Juul Labs, Inc.) with three nicotine concentrations compared to the usual brand 
(UB) cigarettes in 24 adult smokers.
METHODS: At five study visits, subjects used either the JS in 59 mg/mL, JS 18 
mg/mL (two visits), and JS 9 mg/mL (all tobacco-flavored) or smoked their UB 
cigarette first during a controlled puffing sequence (CPS) and then ad libitum 
(5 min) use sessions. Blood samples were taken at specified timepoints for 60 
min in each session. The modified Product Evaluation Scale assessed subjective 
effects 30-min post-use in the CPS session.
RESULTS: Maximum plasma nicotine concentration (Cmax-BL), total nicotine 
exposure (AUC0-60-BL), and rate of plasma nicotine rise were significantly lower 
for all JS products compared to subjects' UB cigarette in CPS and ad libitum use 
sessions. In both use sessions these PK parameters were significantly higher for 
JS 59 mg/mL compared to 18 and 9 mg/mL. Subjective measures of cigarette craving 
relief and "Enough Nicotine" for JS 59 mg/mL did not differ significantly from 
UB cigarettes, but JS 18 and 9 mg/mL were rated significantly lower than JS 59 
mg/mL and UB cigarettes.
CONCLUSIONS: Nicotine exposure and subjective relief were directly related to JS 
nicotine concentration: higher nicotine concentrations gave rise to 
significantly greater plasma nicotine levels and relief from craving. Heavier 
and more dependent smokers may require the greater nicotine delivery of JS 59 
mg/mL to successfully transition away from cigarettes.
IMPLICATIONS: It has been suggested that electronic nicotine delivery systems 
(ENDS) and other alternative nicotine delivery products that more closely mimic 
the nicotine pharmacokinetics (PK) of cigarettes may facilitate smokers 
transitioning away from cigarettes. We examined nicotine PK and subjective 
effects of JUUL System (JS) ENDS with three nicotine concentrations (59, 18 and 
9 mg/mL) compared to combustible cigarettes. Nicotine delivery from JS ENDS was 
nicotine concentration dependent, with higher nicotine concentrations giving 
rise to higher nicotine exposure. These findings suggest that heavier and more 
dependent smokers may require ENDS with nicotine concentrations greater than 20 
mg/mL to successfully transition away from cigarettes.

Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) have been marketed as a less lethal 
substitute for smoking traditional cigarettes. This study aims to investigate 
the impact of e-cigarettes aerosol exposure on lactating dams and pups, whose 
dams were exposed. Lactating dams received fresh air (control) or e-cigarettes 
aerosol during lactation (day 4-21). Maternal exposure to e-cigarettes aerosol 
during lactation induced significant reduction (P < 0.0001) in the fat content 
of the milk and serum Leptin level (P < 0.005) compared to control dams. 
Furthermore, pups whose dams were exposed to e-cigarettes during lactation 
showed an increased level of glucose, thyroxine and decreased level of insulin. 
The exposure to e-cigarettes aerosol during lactation altered the composition of 
milk as well as the hormonal and biochemical profile in dams and pups. This 
result, if observed in women using e-cigarettes, suggests that e-cigarettes' use 
during lactation may have consequences on the milk production and hormonal and 
biochemical profile in breastfeeding mothers and nursing babies.

    Ann Thorac Surg. 2022 Sep;114(3):940.

BACKGROUND: The implementation of McKeown minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) 
is associated with a steep learning curve. However, there is no consensus on the 
number of cases required before effective and safe McKeown MIE can be achieved.
METHODS: Data on consecutive patients with esophageal carcinoma who underwent 
esophagectomy performed by a single surgeon in the Department of Thoracic 
Surgery at Daping Hospital in Chongqing, China from September 2009 to June 2019 
were collected. The cumulative sum learning curve was plotted on the basis of 
the learning associated parameters. Propensity score matching was used to reduce 
selection bias from confounding factors. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to 
assess the survival differences.
RESULTS: The learning curve was divided into the ascending period (cases 1-197), 
the plateau period (198-314), and the descending period (315-onward). After 197 
cases, significant improvements in operative time (300 minutes vs 210minutes; P 
< .001), retrieved lymph nodes (17 vs 20; P = .004), hospital length of stay (18 
days vs 13 days; P = .001), major postoperative complications (38.6% vs 32.5%; P 
< .001), vocal cord palsy (6.1% vs 0.9%; P = .04), and pulmonary complications 
(31.5% vs 17.1%; P = .005) were observed. In addition, after 314 cases, 
significant decreases in blood loss (200 mL vs 100 mL; P < .001), anastomotic 
leak (24.8% vs 14.8%; P = .02), and chylothorax (4.3% vs 0%; P = .001) were 
observed. After propensity score matching, the overall and disease-free survival 
rates were significantly improved during the experienced period (P = .02 and 
.03, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: The initial learning phase of McKeown MIE consisted of 197 
procedures in 51 months. Moreover, the surgeon's experience did have a direct 
impact on the long-term outcomes in patients with esophageal carcinoma.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the beneficial effects of 
synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV) with heliox in newborn 
infants with meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS).
METHODS: Seventy-one newborn infants with MAS in the neonatal intensive care 
unit (NICU) of Daping Hospital of Army Medical University were enrolled in the 
trial. Infants treated with SIMV were randomized and divided into the heliox 
group (n = 35) and control group (n = 36). The heliox group received heliox for 
6 h followed by air-oxygen mixed gas, and the control group received air-oxygen 
mixed gas. The primary outcome measures were PaO2 /FiO2 (P/F) and the extubation 
time. The secondary outcome measures were the incidence of mechanical 
ventilation complications, hospital length of stay in the NICU, blood gas 
analysis, and inflammation markers.
RESULTS: The P/F in the heliox group was significantly better than that in the 
control group (p < .001). The extubation time and hospital length of stay in the 
NICU in the heliox group were shorter than those in the control group 
(p < .001). The inflammation markers at 6 h and myocardial injury markers at 
24 h were decreased compared with those at 0 h, and those in the heliox group 
were more significantly decreased than those in the control group ([interleukin 
{IL}-6/IL-8/tumor necrosis factor α] p < .001, [C-reaction protein] p = .012; 
[creatine kinase] p < .001, [CK-MB] p = .041).
CONCLUSION: Heliox appears to be more effective in reducing the length of 
ventilation and increasing carbon dioxide eliminations than an air-oxygen 
mixture in infants with MAS under the support of SIMV.

Electronic-cigarettes (e-cigarette), the alternative to classic cigarettes are 
becoming extremely popular but their safety is not still established. Recent 
studies have showed cytotoxic effects of the electronic cigarette and its 
recharge e-liquid, in vitro. The present study was designed to evaluate 
e-cigarette liquid nephrotoxicity in rats. For this purpose, 32 rats were 
treated for 28 days as follows: Control group was injected intraperitoneally 
with NaCl 9 g/l; e-cigarette 0% treated group received an intraperitoneal 
injection of e-liquid without nicotine diluted in NaCl 9 g/l, e-cigarette 
treated group, received an intraperitoneal injection of e-liquid containing 
0.5 mg of nicotine/kg of body weight/day diluted in NaCl 9 g/l and 
nicotine-treated group received an intraperitoneal injection of 0.5 mg of 
nicotine/kg of body weight/day diluted in NaCl 9 g/l. In nicotine group, 
creatinine level was increased, whereas urea and acid uric levels were 
decreased. In e-liquid-exposed groups, levels of uric acid and mainly urea were 
lower. Interestingly, after e-liquid exposure, oxidative stress status showed 
increased total protein and sulfhydril content, whereas superoxide dismutase and 
catalase activities were decreased. However, the levels of lipid peroxides were 
not increased after e-liquid exposure. Histological studies identified excess of 
cells with reduced and dark nuclei exclusively located in the renal collecting 
ducts. Thus, e-liquid seems to alter anti-oxidant defense and to promote minor 
changes in renal function parameters. This preliminary study raises some flags 
about possible nephrotoxicity of e-cigarette liquids in rats. As some features 
observed in rats may not be observed in human smokers, additional studies are 
needed to further qualify conclusions that might be applicable to actual users 
of e-cigarettes.

Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) have become increasingly popular in young 
generations in the United States. Because the adverse pregnancy outcomes 
associated with combustible cigarette smoking are well-recognized, many pregnant 
women switch to e-cigarettes believing that this alternative is low in toxic 
chemicals. However, most e-cigarettes contain nicotine, which can easily pass 
through the placenta and accumulate to a high concentration in fetal blood 
circulation. Studies have also detected toxic metals (eg, lead, cadmium, and 
nickel) in e-cigarettes, and carbonyl compounds and flavorings, which are 
suggested to be irritative and even carcinogenic. There are questions that need 
to be answered about the risks of e-cigarette exposure during pregnancy. 
Unfortunately, research evaluating the association between maternal e-cigarette 
exposure and offspring health is scarce, especially with regard to human 
studies. Some evidence from laboratory and animal studies, although 
inconsistent, showed that maternal exposure to e-cigarette vapor may lead to 
restricted growth of offspring. E-cigarette exposure may also have an impact on 
the metabolic health of offspring, manifested as distorted glucose homeostasis 
and energy metabolism. In addition, in utero exposure may lead to defects in 
respiratory, vascular, and neurologic system development. For humans, 
investigations mostly focused on immediate birth outcomes such as 
small-for-gestational-age neonates, low birthweight, and preterm birth; however, 
the results were inconclusive. Research also suggests that maternal e-cigarette 
exposure may result in compromised neurodevelopment in newborns. In summary, 
current evidence is insufficient to rigorously evaluate the health impacts of 
maternal e-cigarette use on offspring development. Future investigations are 
warranted.

BACKGROUND: Concern about intoxication by e-liquid is growing as calls to poison 
control centers have increased since their introduction. Only three cases of 
intoxication by injection have been reported worldwide. Our case is unique 
because of the precise follow-up of a patient who survived a lethal dose of 
self-injected e-liquid, without other co-intoxication.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 51-year-old male presented to the Emergency Department 
after injecting himself intravenously (IV) in the forearm with 10 mL of e-liquid 
(1000 mg of nicotine diluted in propylene glycol). An agitation phase was 
followed by coma and bradypnoea requiring mechanical ventilation. The patient 
developed a transitory neurological impairment with the appearance of 
tetraparesis, gaze palsy and myoclonus due to nicotinic syndrome. The arterial 
blood gas (ABG) analysis confirmed uncompensated lactic acidosis with an 
elevated anion gap, which is an expected effect of propylene glycol. The 
toxicology screen indicated the presence of nicotine and cotinine in the blood 
and excluded the presence of concomitant intoxication. The patient recovered 
without sequelae.
CONCLUSION: Even a small quantity of intravenous (IV) e-liquid can lead to an 
acute intoxication and fatal outcomes due to the toxic effects of nicotine. This 
case might help emergency doctors cope with acute intoxication by injection of 
e-liquid and increase their comprehension of the two main substances, nicotine 
and propylene glycol with overview of their pharmacodynamics and kinetic 
effects.

Tobacco combustion exposure worsens rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Non-combustible 
tobacco devices, as heat-not-burn tobacco (HNBT), are emerging as harm reduction 
to smokers by releasing nicotine and lower combustible tobacco products. 
Nevertheless, HNBT toxicity remains unclear. Hence, here we investigated the 
impacts of the tobacco combustible product (cigarette smoke; CS) or HNBT vapor 
exposures on antigen-induced arthritis (AIA) in C57BL/6 mice. Animals were 
exposed to airflow, HNBT vapor, or CS during 1 h/twice a day, under the Health 
Canada Intense (HCI) smoking regime, between days 14 to 20 after the first 
immunization. At day 21, 16 h after the last exposures, mice were i.a. 
challenged and the AIA effects were evaluated 24 h later. CS- or HNBT-exposed 
mice presented equivalent blood nicotine levels. CS exposure worsened articular 
symptoms, pulmonary inflammation, and expression of lung metallothioneins. 
Nevertheless, CS or HNBT exposures reduced lymphoid organs' cellularity, 
splenocyte proliferation and IL-2 secretion. Additional in vitro CS or HNBT 
exposures confirmed the harmful effects on splenocytes, which were partially 
mediated by the activation of nicotine/α7nAchR pathway. Associated, data 
demonstrate the toxic mechanisms of CS or HNBT inhalation at HCI regime on RA, 
and highlight that further investigations are fundamental to assure the toxicity 
of emerging tobacco products on the immune system during specific challenges.

Objective: To explore the value of catheter-based adrenal ablation in treating 
Cushing's syndrome (CS)-associated hypertension. Methods: A clinical study was 
conducted in patients with CS, who received catheter-based adrenal ablation 
between March 2018 and July 2023 in Daping Hospital. Parameters monitored were 
blood pressure (outpatient and 24-hour ambulatory), body weight, clinical 
characteristics, serum cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) at 8 am, 
24-hour urinary free cortisol (24 h UFC), fasting blood glucose and 
postoperative complications. Procedure effectiveness was defined as blood 
pressure returning to normal levels (systolic blood pressure<140 mmHg (1 
mmHg=0.133 kPa) and diastolic blood pressure<90 mmHg), cortisol and 24 h UFC 
returning to normal and improvement of clinical characteristics. The parameters 
were monitored during follow up in the outpatient department at 1, 3, 6, and 12 
months after catheter-based adrenal ablation. Results: A total of 12 patients 
(aged (40.0±13.2) years) were reviewed. There were 5 males, with 5 cases of 
adenoma and 7 with hyperplasia from imaging studies. Catheter-based adrenal 
ablation was successful in all without interruption or surgical conversion. No 
postoperative complication including bleeding, puncture site infection, adrenal 
artery rupture or adrenal bleeding was observed. The mean follow up was 28 
months. Compared to baseline values, body weight declined to (59.48±11.65) kg 
from (64.81±10.75) kg (P=0.008), fasting blood glucose declined to (4.54±0.83) 
mmol from (5.53±0.99) mmol (P=0.044), outpatient systolic blood pressure 
declined to (128±21) mmHg from (140±19) mmHg (P=0.005), diastolic blood pressure 
declined to (78±10) mmHg from (86±11) mmHg (P=0.041), and the mean ambulatory 
daytime diastolic blood pressure declined to (79±12) mmHg from (89±8) mmHg 
(P=0.034). Catheter-based adrenal ablation in 8 patients was defined as 
effective with their 24 h UFC significantly reduced after the procedure (1 
338.41±448.06) mmol/L from (633.66±315.94) mmol/L, P=0.011). The change of 24 h 
UFC between the effective treatment group and ineffective group was 
statistically significant (P=0.020). The postoperative systolic blood pressure 
in the treated adenoma group was significantly lower than those of hyperplasia 
group (112±13) mmHg vs. (139±20) mmHg, P=0.026). Conclusions: For patients with 
CS-associated hypertension who are unwilling or unable to undergo surgical 
treatment, catheter-based adrenal ablation could improve the blood pressure and 
cortisol level. Catheter-based adrenal ablation could be a safe, effective, and 
minimally invasive therapy. However, our results still need to be validated in 
further large-scale studies.

结论： 
对于不愿或者不能行外科手术的CS相关性高血压患者，经导管肾上腺消融术可改善血压和皮质功能，是一种安全有效的微创治疗方法，但仍需大样本临床研究进一步验证。.

INTRODUCTION: Dynamic inhalation scintigraphy (DIS) with 
technetium-99m-diethylenetriamine-pentaacetate aerosol is a useful nuclear 
medicine procedure for staging and monitoring the damage of alveolocapillary 
membrane. The e-cigarette is a new popular smoking device producing vapor from 
the nicotine solution. Many studies have shown that e-cigarettes appear to be 
safer than smoking, but there are still debates to what extent e-cigarettes are 
less harmful than smoking.In this prospective, self-controlled study, we 
compared DIS results among volunteers smoking an e-cigarette and their results 
after they returned to traditional cigarette smoking for a week.
PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: We included 24 healthy volunteers into this study who 
regularly used e-cigarette containing at least 10 mg nicotine/ml. We performed 
baseline DIS study in volunteers with e-cigarette smoking and then we asked them 
to return to traditional cigarette smoking for a week. Conventional respiration 
tests were also measured. We statistically analyzed the effect of traditional 
cigarette on clinical parameters and pulmonary clearance of the radiopharmacon.
RESULTS: There was no significant change in the parameters of peak expiratory 
flow rate and Tiffeneau-Pinelli index respiration tests; forced vital capacity 
and forced expiratory volume in 1 s slightly decreased (P<0.05), whereas the 
exhaled CO and COHb levels were significantly higher at traditional cigarette 
use (P<0.0001), and increased in every case. The pulmonary clearance was 
significantly faster at traditional cigarette smoking compared with e-cigarette 
use (P<0.0001).
CONCLUSION: On the basis of our results, we suppose that e-cigarette smoking is 
less harmful to the lung function than a traditional cigarette, and it can be 
recommended to heavy smokers who are unable to stop smoking.

RATIONALE: Tobacco harm reduction (THR) involves encouraging adult smokers who 
would otherwise continue to smoke to transition to less harmful forms of 
nicotine delivery. These products must offer adult smokers reduced exposure to 
chemicals associated with tobacco combustion, satisfactory blood plasma nicotine 
levels and serve as an acceptable alternative. The most recent THR innovation is 
tobacco-free oral nicotine pouches.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to compare pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and 
safety and tolerability profiles of two nicotine pouch variants (ZoneX #2 
(5.8 mg nicotine/pouch); ZoneX #3 (10.1 mg nicotine/pouch)) with cigarette to 
assess the pouches' THR potential.
METHODS: This was a controlled use, randomised, open-label, cross-over clinical 
study with 24 healthy adult traditional tobacco users. Pharmacokinetic (plasma 
nicotine levels; up to 8 h post-use), pharmacodynamic (urge to smoke, product 
liking; up to 4 h post-use) and short-term safety and tolerability profiles were 
assessed.
RESULTS: Distinct nicotine pouch pharmacokinetic profiles indicated nicotine 
absorption via the oral mucosa. Plasma nicotine levels were lower, and time to 
peak slower, for the nicotine pouches compared to cigarette (Cmax cigarette: 
11.6 ng/ml vs. #2: 5.2 ng/ml, p < 0.0001; #3: 7.9 ng/ml, p < 0.0003) (Tmax 
cigarette: 8.6 min vs. #2: 26 min; #3: 22 min). All products effectively reduced 
subjects' urge to smoke and presented favourable product liking scores; nicotine 
pouches were also well tolerated following short-term use (no serious adverse 
events).
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the assessed ZoneX nicotine pouches may offer an 
acceptable alternative for adult smokers to achieve satisfactory levels of 
nicotine delivery and, based on the pharmacokinetic parameters and under the 
study conditions, likely have a lower abuse liability and addictive potential 
for current adult smokers compared to continued cigarette smoking.

This issue of the Biomedical Journal tells us about the risks of electronic 
cigarette smoking, variations of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2, and how COVID-19 affects 
the gastrointestinal system. Moreover, we learn that cancer immunotherapy seems 
to work well in elderly patients, how thyroid hormones regulate noncoding RNAs 
in a liver tumour context, and that G6PD is a double-edged sword of redox

that artificial neural networks can diagnose COVID-19 patients and predict

INTRODUCTION: Electronic cigarettes (EC) have the potential to generate a 
substantial public health benefit if there is a switch from smoking to EC use on 
a population scale. The nicotine delivery from EC is likely to play a major role 
in their attractiveness to smokers. We assessed nicotine delivery from a 
first-generation EC and the effect of experience with its use on nicotine 
intake.
METHODS: Six smokers provided pharmacokinetic (PK) data after their first use of 
EC and again following 4 weeks of use.
RESULTS: The peak nicotine levels were achieved within 5 min of starting the EC 
use, which suggests that EC may provide nicotine via pulmonary absorption. There 
were large individual differences in nicotine intake. Compared with the PK 
profile when using EC for the first time, 4 weeks of practice generated a 24% 
increase in the peak plasma concentrations (from 4.6 to 5.7 ng/ml; 
nonsignificant) and a 79% increase in overall nicotine intake (AUC(0 → inf) 
increased from 115 to 206 ng*min/ml; p < .05).
CONCLUSIONS: First-generation EC provide faster nicotine absorption than 
nicotine replacement products, but to compete successfully with conventional 
cigarettes, EC may need to provide higher doses of nicotine. Nicotine intake 
from EC can increase with practice, but further studies are needed to confirm 
this effect.

BACKGROUND: Electronic cigarettes (ECs) are handheld electronic vaping devices 
which produce an aerosol by heating an e-liquid. Some people who smoke use ECs 
to stop or reduce smoking, although some organizations, advocacy groups and 
policymakers have discouraged this, citing lack of evidence of efficacy and 
safety. People who smoke, healthcare providers and regulators want to know if 
ECs can help people quit smoking, and if they are safe to use for this purpose. 
This is a review update conducted as part of a living systematic review.
OBJECTIVES: To examine the effectiveness, tolerability, and safety of using 
electronic cigarettes (ECs) to help people who smoke tobacco achieve long-term 
smoking abstinence.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's Specialized 
Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, 
Embase, and PsycINFO to 1 July 2022, and reference-checked and contacted study 
authors.  SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) 
and randomized cross-over trials, in which people who smoke were randomized to 
an EC or control condition. We also included uncontrolled intervention studies 
in which all participants received an EC intervention. Studies had to report 
abstinence from cigarettes at six months or longer or data on safety markers at 
one week or longer, or both.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We followed standard Cochrane methods for 
screening and data extraction. Our primary outcome measures were abstinence from 
smoking after at least six months follow-up, adverse events (AEs), and serious 
adverse events (SAEs). Secondary outcomes included the proportion of people 
still using study product (EC or pharmacotherapy) at six or more months after 
randomization or starting EC use, changes in carbon monoxide (CO), blood 
pressure (BP), heart rate, arterial oxygen saturation, lung function, and levels 
of carcinogens or toxicants, or both. We used a fixed-effect Mantel-Haenszel 
model to calculate risk ratios (RRs) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) for 
dichotomous outcomes. For continuous outcomes, we calculated mean differences. 
Where appropriate, we pooled data in meta-analyses.
MAIN RESULTS: We included 78 completed studies, representing 22,052 
participants, of which 40 were RCTs. Seventeen of the 78 included studies were 
new to this review update. Of the included studies, we rated ten (all but one 
contributing to our main comparisons) at low risk of bias overall, 50 at high 
risk overall (including all non-randomized studies), and the remainder at 
unclear risk. There was high certainty that quit rates were higher in people 
randomized to nicotine EC than in those randomized to nicotine replacement 
therapy (NRT) (RR 1.63, 95% CI 1.30 to 2.04; I2 = 10%; 6 studies, 2378 
participants). In absolute terms, this might translate to an additional four 
quitters per 100 (95% CI 2 to 6). There was moderate-certainty evidence (limited 
by imprecision) that the rate of occurrence of AEs was similar between groups 
(RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.19; I2 = 0%; 4 studies, 1702 participants). SAEs were 
rare, but there was insufficient evidence to determine whether rates differed 
between groups due to very serious imprecision (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.52; I2 
= 34%; 5 studies, 2411 participants). There was moderate-certainty evidence, 
limited by imprecision, that quit rates were higher in people randomized to 
nicotine EC than to non-nicotine EC (RR 1.94, 95% CI 1.21 to 3.13; I2 = 0%; 5 
studies, 1447 participants). In absolute terms, this might lead to an additional 
seven quitters per 100 (95% CI 2 to 16). There was moderate-certainty evidence 
of no difference in the rate of AEs between these groups (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.91 
to 1.11; I2 = 0%; 5 studies, 1840 participants). There was insufficient evidence 
to determine whether rates of SAEs differed between groups, due to very serious 
imprecision (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.79; I2 = 0%; 8 studies, 1272 
participants). Compared to behavioural support only/no support, quit rates were 
higher for participants randomized to nicotine EC (RR 2.66, 95% CI 1.52 to 4.65; 
I2 = 0%; 7 studies, 3126 participants). In absolute terms, this represents an 
additional two quitters per 100 (95% CI 1 to 3). However, this finding was of 
very low certainty, due to issues with imprecision and risk of bias. There was 
some evidence that (non-serious) AEs were more common in people randomized to 
nicotine EC (RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.32; I2 = 41%, low certainty; 4 studies, 
765 participants) and, again, insufficient evidence to determine whether rates 
of SAEs differed between groups (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.97; I2 = 38%; 9 
studies, 1993 participants).  Data from non-randomized studies were consistent 
with RCT data. The most commonly reported AEs were throat/mouth irritation, 
headache, cough, and nausea, which tended to dissipate with continued EC use. 
Very few studies reported data on other outcomes or comparisons, hence evidence 
for these is limited, with CIs often encompassing clinically significant harm 
and benefit.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is high-certainty evidence that ECs with nicotine 
increase quit rates compared to NRT and moderate-certainty evidence that they 
increase quit rates compared to ECs without nicotine. Evidence comparing 
nicotine EC with usual care/no treatment also suggests benefit, but is less 
certain. More studies are needed to confirm the effect size. Confidence 
intervals were for the most part wide for data on AEs, SAEs and other safety 
markers, with no difference in AEs between nicotine and non-nicotine ECs nor 
between nicotine ECs and NRT. Overall incidence of SAEs was low across all study 
arms. We did not detect evidence of serious harm from nicotine EC, but longest 
follow-up was two years and the number of studies was small. The main limitation 
of the evidence base remains imprecision due to the small number of RCTs, often 
with low event rates, but further RCTs are underway. To ensure the review 
continues to provide up-to-date information to decision-makers, this review is a 
living systematic review. We run searches monthly, with the review updated when 
relevant new evidence becomes available. Please refer to the Cochrane Database 
of Systematic Reviews for the review's current status.

Kupffer cells are liver resident macrophages that are responsible for screening 
and clearing blood of pathogens and foreign particles. It has recently been 
shown that Kupffer cells interact with platelets, through an adhesion based 
mechanism, to aid in pathogen clearance and then these platelets re-enter the 
general systemic circulation. Thus, a mechanism has been identified that relates 
liver inflammation to possible changes in the systemic circulation. However, the 
role that Kupffer cells play in cardiovascular disease initiation/progression 
has not been elucidated. Thus, our objective was to determine whether or not 
Kupffer cells are responsive to a classical cardiovascular risk factor and if 
these changes can be transmitted into the general systemic circulation. If 
Kupffer cells initiate inflammatory responses after exposure to classical 
cardiovascular risk factors, then this provides a potential 
alternative/synergistic pathway for cardiovascular disease initiation. We aimed 
to elucidate the prevalence of this potential pathway. We hypothesized that 
Kupffer cells would initiate a robust inflammatory response after exposure to 
tobacco cigarette or e-cigarette products and that the inflammatory response 
would have the potential to antagonize other salient cells for cardiovascular 
disease progression. To test this, Kupffer cells were incubated with tobacco 
smoke extracts, e-cigarette vapor extracts or pure nicotine. Complement 
deposition onto Kupffer cells, Kupffer cell complement receptor expression, 
oxidative stress production, cytokine release and viability and density were 
assessed after the exposure. We observed a robust inflammatory response, 
oxidative stress production and cytokine release after Kupffer cells were 
exposed to tobacco or e-cigarette extracts. We also observed a marginal decrease 
in cell viability coupled with a significant decrease in cell density. In 
general, this was not a function of the extract formulation (e.g. tobacco vs. 
e-cigarette products or the formulation of the cigarette product). These results 
indicate that Kupffer cells are responsive to classical cardiovascular risk 
factors and that an inflammatory response is initiated that may pass into the 
general systemic circulation.

The increasing availability of e-cigarettes is a potential toxicological 
concern. E-cigarettes appeared on the Polish market in 2006, and since 2009 they 
have been widely available with a new source of nicotine, the so-called 
e-liquid. In this paper two cases of suicidal oral and intravenous poisonings 
with the e-liquid are described. The clinical courses of these poisonings are 
presented. Nicotine and cotinine concentrations in the patient's blood were 
determined using high performance liquid chromatography with diode array 
detection. In the course of intoxication patient No. 1, classic symptoms of 
acute nicotine poisoning without convulsions were observed. Nicotine and 
cotinine concentrations measured in serum were 0.096 and 4.4mg/L, respectively. 
The case of patient No. 2, admission with no typical symptoms of nicotine 
poisoning was identified, except unconsciousness and slow respiration. Nicotine 
and cotinine concentrations in the serum at the time of No. 2 admissions were 
determined to be 0.8 and 1.3mg/L, respectively. With the increasing number of 
e-liquid poisonings cases, it should be aware that these products can be a 
readily available source of poison.

RATIONALE: Previous studies report sex differences in some, but not all, 
responses to cannabinoids in rats. The majority of studies use parenteral 
injection; however, most human use is via smoke inhalation and, increasingly, 
vapor inhalation.
OBJECTIVES: To compare thermoregulatory and locomotor responses to inhaled 
∆9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol (CBD), and their combination using an 
e-cigarette-based model in male and female rats METHODS: Male and female Wistar 
rats were implanted with radiotelemetry devices for the assessment of body 
temperature and locomotor activity. Animals were then exposed to THC or CBD 
vapor using a propylene glycol (PG) vehicle. THC dose was adjusted via the 
concentration in the vehicle (12.5-200 mg/mL) and the CBD (100, 400 mg/mL) dose 
was also adjusted by varying the inhalation duration (10-40 min). 
Anti-nociception was evaluated using a tail-withdrawal assay following vapor 
inhalation. Plasma samples obtained following inhalation in different groups of 
rats were compared for THC content.
RESULTS: THC inhalation reduced body temperature and increased tail-withdrawal 
latency in both sexes equivalently and in a concentration-dependent manner. 
Female temperature, activity, and tail-withdrawal responses to THC did not 
differ between estrus and diestrus. CBD inhalation alone induced modest 
hypothermia and suppressed locomotor activity in both males and females. 
Co-administration of THC with CBD, in a 1:4 ratio, significantly decreased 
temperature and activity in an approximately additive manner and to similar 
extent in each sex. Plasma THC varied with the concentration in the PG vehicle 
but did not differ across rat sex.
CONCLUSION: In summary, the inhalation of THC or CBD, alone and in combination, 
produces approximately equivalent effects in male and female rats. This confirms 
the efficacy of the e-cigarette-based method of THC delivery in female rats.

MiR-155-Mediated Deregulation of GPER1 Plays an Important Role in the Gender 
Differences Related to Inflammatory Bowel Disease.

AIM: The incidence and clinical manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease 
(IBD) are thought to have gender differences, which suggests that the estrogen 
signaling pathway and intestinal flora may play key roles in the pathogenesis of 
IBD. In IBD, microRNA-155 (miR-155) is upregulated and regulates G protein 
coupled estrogen receptor (GPER1), which affects the intestinal flora. The 
objective of this study was to investigate the role of the estrogen receptors 
and miR-155 in the pathogenesis of IBD.
METHODS: From July 2018 to July 2019, in the Department of Gastroenterology at 
Daping Hospital, Army Military Medical University, a total of 50 patients with 
IBD were included in this study, and 24 healthy examinees were randomly selected 
as the control group. Colonoscopies were performed, and clinical characteristics 
and blood samples were collected from all of the subjects. The serum cytokine 
levels in the patients with IBD and the health donors were detected by ELISA, 
and the estrogen receptor level measurements for all of the participants were 
assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). 
The miR-155 levels were detected by qPCR in all of the participants, and 
miR-155-/- mice were used to investigate the mechanism of miR-155 in the 
pathogenesis of IBD.
RESULTS: The clinical characteristics and medications were different for the IBD 
patients when gender was considered. The male patients produced more 
proinflammatory cytokines, and while GPER1 expression was downregulated, miR-155 
was upregulated in the patients with IBD. MiR-155 showed proinflammatory 
activity, while GPER1 showed an anti-inflammatory response during the 
pathogenesis of IBD. The miR-155-/- mice showed improvements in weight loss, 
survival, rectal bleeding, colon length, and histopathological changes compared 
with the wild-type mice. Furthermore, the male miR-155-/- mice showed increased 
inflammation compared to the female miR-155-/- mice in the above aspects.
CONCLUSION: This study presents evidence indicating that miR-155 plays a key 
role in the pathogenesis of IBD for the different genders. MiR-155 was 
upregulated and showed proinflammatory activity, whereas GPER1 showed an 
anti-inflammatory response during the pathogenesis of IBD. The results 
demonstrated that more proinflammatory cytokines and reduced GPER1 levels were 
observed in the male IBD patients. Thus, miR-155 was involved in the regulation 
of GPER1 and induced gender differences in IBD patients. MiR-155 may be a 
potential marker for IBD-targeted therapy.

BACKGROUND: Populations experiencing homelessness have high rates of tobacco use 
and experience substantial barriers to cessation. Tobacco-caused conditions are 
among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among people experiencing 
homelessness, highlighting an urgent need for interventions to reduce the burden 
of tobacco use in this population.
OBJECTIVES: To assess whether interventions designed to improve access to 
tobacco cessation interventions for adults experiencing homelessness lead to 
increased numbers engaging in or receiving treatment, and whether interventions 
designed to help adults experiencing homelessness to quit tobacco lead to 
increased tobacco abstinence. To also assess whether tobacco cessation 
interventions for adults experiencing homelessness affect substance use and 
mental health.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialized 
Register, MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO for studies using the terms: un-housed*, 
homeless*, housing instability, smoking cessation, tobacco use disorder, 
smokeless tobacco. We also searched trial registries to identify unpublished 
studies. Date of the most recent search: 06 January 2020.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials that recruited 
people experiencing homelessness who used tobacco, and investigated 
interventions focused on the following: 1) improving access to relevant support 
services; 2) increasing motivation to quit tobacco use; 3) helping people to 
achieve abstinence, including but not limited to behavioral support, tobacco 
cessation pharmacotherapies, contingency management, and text- or app-based 
interventions; or 4) encouraging transitions to long-term nicotine use that did 
not involve tobacco. Eligible comparators included no intervention, usual care 
(as defined by the studies), or another form of active intervention.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We followed standard Cochrane methods. Tobacco 
cessation was measured at the longest time point for each study, on an 
intention-to-treat basis, using the most rigorous definition available. We 
calculated risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for smoking 
cessation for each study where possible. We grouped eligible studies according 
to the type of comparison (contingent reinforcement in addition to usual smoking 
cessation care; more versus less intensive smoking cessation interventions; and 
multi-issue support versus smoking cessation support only), and carried out 
meta-analyses where appropriate, using a Mantel-Haenszel random-effects model. 
We also extracted data on quit attempts, effects on mental and substance-use 
severity, and meta-analyzed these outcomes where sufficient data were available.
MAIN RESULTS: We identified 10 studies involving 1634 participants who smoked 
combustible tobacco at enrolment. One of the studies was ongoing. Most of the 
trials included participants who were recruited from community-based sites such 
as shelters, and three included participants who were recruited from clinics. We 
judged three studies to be at high risk of bias in one or more domains. We 
identified low-certainty evidence, limited by imprecision, that contingent 
reinforcement (rewards for successful smoking cessation) plus usual smoking 
cessation care was not more effective than usual care alone in promoting 
abstinence (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.16 to 2.77; 1 trial, 70 participants). We 
identified very low-certainty evidence, limited by risk of bias and imprecision, 
that more intensive behavioral smoking cessation support was more effective than 
brief intervention in promoting abstinence at six-month follow-up (RR 1.64, 95% 
CI 1.01 to 2.69; 3 trials, 657 participants; I2 = 0%). There was low-certainty 
evidence, limited by bias and imprecision, that multi-issue support (cessation 
support that also encompassed help to deal with other challenges or addictions) 
was not superior to targeted smoking cessation support in promoting abstinence 
(RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.35 to 2.61; 2 trials, 146 participants; I2 = 25%). More data 
on these types of interventions are likely to change our interpretation of these 
data. Single studies that examined the effects of text-messaging support, 
e-cigarettes, or cognitive behavioral therapy for smoking cessation provided 
inconclusive results. Data on secondary outcomes, including mental health and 
substance use severity, were too sparse to draw any meaningful conclusions on 
whether there were clinically-relevant differences. We did not identify any 
studies that explicitly assessed interventions to increase access to tobacco 
cessation care; we were therefore unable to assess our secondary outcome 'number 
of participants receiving treatment'.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to assess the effects of 
any tobacco cessation interventions specifically in people experiencing 
homelessness. Although there was some evidence to suggest a modest benefit of 
more intensive behavioral smoking cessation interventions when compared to less 
intensive interventions, our certainty in this evidence was very low, meaning 
that further research could either strengthen or weaken this effect. There is 
insufficient evidence to assess whether the provision of tobacco cessation 
support and its effects on quit attempts has any effect on the mental health or 
other substance-use outcomes of people experiencing homelessness. Although there 
is no reason to believe that standard tobacco cessation treatments work any 
differently in people experiencing homelessness than in the general population, 
these findings highlight a need for high-quality studies that address additional 
ways to engage and support people experiencing homelessness, in the context of 
the daily challenges they face. These studies should have adequate power and put 
effort into retaining participants for long-term follow-up of at least six 
months. Studies should also explore interventions that increase access to 
cessation services, and address the social and environmental influences of 
tobacco use among people experiencing homelessness. Finally, studies should 
explore the impact of tobacco cessation on mental health and substance-use 
outcomes.

Since electronic cigarette (ECIG) introduction to American markets in 2007, 
vaping has surged in popularity. Many, including women of reproductive age, also 
believe that ECIG use is safer than traditional tobacco cigarettes and is not 
hazardous when pregnant. However, there are few studies investigating the 
effects of ECIG exposure on the developing embryo and nothing is known about 
potential effects on craniofacial development. Therefore, we have tested the 
effects of several aerosolized e-cigarette liquids (e-cigAM) in an in vivo 
craniofacial model, Xenopus laevis, as well as a mammalian neural crest cell 
line. Results demonstrate that e-cigAM exposure during embryonic development 
induces a variety of defects, including median facial clefts and midface 
hypoplasia in two of e-cigAMs tested e-cigAMs. Detailed quantitative analyses of 
the facial morphology revealed that nicotine is not the main factor in inducing 
craniofacial defects, but can exacerbate the effects of the other e-liquid 
components. Additionally, while two different e-cigAMs can have very similar 
consequences on facial appearances, there are subtle differences that could be 
due to the differences in e-cigAM components. Further assessment of embryos 
exposed to these particular e-cigAMs revealed cranial cartilage and muscle 
defects and a reduction in the blood supply to the face. Finally, the expression 
of markers for vascular and cartilage differentiation was reduced in a mammalian 
neural crest cell line corroborating the in vivo effects. Our work is the first 
to show that ECIG use could pose a potential hazard to the developing embryo and 
cause craniofacial birth defects. This emphasizes the need for more testing and 
regulation of this new popular product.

BACKGROUND: Recently, many studies focused on type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) 
patients with body mass index (BMI) < 30 kg/m2 and suggested that those patients 
might benefit from Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). However, evidence on its 
effectiveness to improve T2DM patients with BMI < 30 kg/m2 is still lacking. The 
aim of this study is to explore whether T2DM patients with BMI < 30 kg/m2 get 
similar surgical effect from RYGB compared with those patients with BMI 
> 30 kg/m2.
METHODOLOGY: Seventy patients with uncontrolled T2DM underwent laparoscopic RYGB 
from May 2010 to December 2015 in the GI Department of Daping Hospital. Weight, 
BMI, waist circumference, glucose, and lipid metabolic parameters were collected 
and evaluated at baseline and 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months postsurgery. Patients 
with BMI < 30 kg/m2 were compared with those with BMI > 30 kg/m2.
RESULTS: Among the 70 patients, 47 (67.1%) BMI < 30 kg/m2, and 23 (32.9%) BMI 
> 30 kg/m2. Patients with BMI < 30 kg/m2 are significantly older; they are 
female predominant and have longer duration of diabetes. The complete remission 
of T2DM was 28.2% of the BMI < 30 kg/m2 group and 57.9% of the BMI > 30 kg/m2 
group (p = 0.029). There was no significant difference in the change of glucose 
and lipid metabolic parameters of both groups. FPG, 2hPG, and HbA1c% levels were 
significantly improved after 1 month (p < 0.05), and then remained essentially 
stable from the sixth month in both groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The 2-year study has shown that RYGB is a safe and effective 
procedure in treating T2DM with BMI < 30 kg/m2, although the complete remission 
of T2DM in the BMI < 30 kg/m2 group is lower than the BMI > 30 kg/m2 group.

Electronic (e)-cigarettes theoretically may be safer than conventional tobacco. 
However, our prior studies demonstrated direct adverse effects of e-cigarette 
vapor (EV) on airway cells, including decreased viability and function. We 
hypothesize that repetitive, chronic inhalation of EV will diminish airway 
barrier function, leading to inflammatory protein release into circulation, 
creating a systemic inflammatory state, ultimately leading to distant organ 
injury and dysfunction. C57BL/6 and CD-1 mice underwent nose only EV exposure 
daily for 3-6 mo, followed by cardiorenal physiological testing. Primary human 
bronchial epithelial cells were grown at an air-liquid interface and exposed to 
EV for 15 min daily for 3-5 days before functional testing. Daily inhalation of 
EV increased circulating proinflammatory and profibrotic proteins in both 
C57BL/6 and CD-1 mice: the greatest increases observed were in angiopoietin-1 
(31-fold) and EGF (25-fold). Proinflammatory responses were recapitulated by 
daily EV exposures in vitro of human airway epithelium, with EV epithelium 
secreting higher IL-8 in response to infection (227 vs. 37 pg/ml, respectively; 
P < 0.05). Chronic EV inhalation in vivo reduced renal filtration by 20% ( P = 
0.017). Fibrosis, assessed by Masson's trichrome and Picrosirius red staining, 
was increased in EV kidneys (1.86-fold, C57BL/6; 3.2-fold, CD-1; P < 0.05), 
heart (2.75-fold, C57BL/6 mice; P < 0.05), and liver (1.77-fold in CD-1; P < 
0.0001). Gene expression changes demonstrated profibrotic pathway activation. EV 
inhalation altered cardiovascular function, with decreased heart rate ( P < 
0.01), and elevated blood pressure ( P = 0.016). These data demonstrate that 
chronic inhalation of EV may lead to increased inflammation, organ damage, and 
cardiorenal and hepatic disease.

Exposure to tobacco smoke, which contains several harmful and potentially 
harmful constituents such as acrolein increases cardiovascular disease (CVD) 
risk. Although high acrolein levels induce pervasive cardiovascular injury, the 
effects of low-level exposure remain unknown and sensitive biomarkers of 
acrolein toxicity have not been identified. Identification of such biomarkers is 
essential to assess the toxicity of acrolein present at low levels in the 
ambient air or in new tobacco products such as e-cigarettes. Hence, we examined 
the systemic effects of chronic (12 weeks) acrolein exposure at concentrations 
similar to those found in tobacco smoke (0.5 or 1 ppm). Acrolein exposure in 
mice led to a 2- to 3-fold increase in its urinary metabolite 3-hydroxypropyl 
mercapturic acid (3-HPMA) with an attendant increase in pulmonary levels of the 
acrolein-metabolizing enzymes, glutathione S-transferase P and aldose reductase, 
as well as several Nrf2-regulated antioxidant proteins. Markers of pulmonary 
endoplasmic reticulum stress and inflammation were unchanged. Exposure to 
acrolein suppressed circulating levels of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) 
and specific leukocyte subsets (eg, GR-1+ cells, CD19+ B-cells, CD4+ T-cells; 
CD11b+ monocytes) whilst other subsets (eg, CD8+ cells, NK1.1+ cells, Ly6C+ 
monocytes) were unchanged. Chronic acrolein exposure did not affect systemic 
glucose tolerance, platelet-leukocyte aggregates or microparticles in blood. 
These findings suggest that circulating levels of EPCs and specific leukocyte 
populations are sensitive biomarkers of inhaled acrolein injury and that 
low-level (<0.5 ppm) acrolein exposure (eg, in secondhand smoke, vehicle 
exhaust, e-cigarettes) could increase CVD risk by diminishing endothelium repair 
or by suppressing immune cells or both.

Many laboratories in Poland do not use gas chromatography (GC) method for 
determination of ethylene glycol (EG) and methanol in blood of poisoned 
patients, they use non specific spectrophotometry methods. One of the 
interfering substances is propylene glycol (PG)--compound present in many 
medical and cosmetic products: drops, air freshens, disinfectants, electronic 
cigarettes and others. In Laboratory of Analytical Toxicology and Drug 
Monitoring in Krakow determination of EG is made by GC method. The method 
enables to distinguish and make resolution of (EG) and (PG) in biological 
samples. In the years 2011-2012 in several serum samples from diagnosed patients 
PG was present in concentration from several to higher than 100 mg/dL. The aim 
of the study was to estimate PG interferences of serum EG determination by 
spectrophotometry method. Serum samples containing PG and EG were used in the 
study. The samples were analyzed by two methods: GC and spectrophotometry. 
Results of serum samples spiked with PG with no EG analysed by spectrophotometry 
method were improper ("false positive"). The results were correlated to PG 
concentration in samples. Calculated cross-reactivity of PG in the method was 
42%. Positive results of EG measured by spectrophotometry method must be 
confirmed by reference GC method. Spectrophotometry method shouldn't be used for 
diagnostics and monitoring of patients poisoned by EG.

A prototype electronic cigaret device and three formulations were evaluated in a 
90-day rat inhalation study followed by a 42-day recovery period. Animals were 
randomly assigned to groups for exposure to low-, mid- and high-dose levels of 
aerosols composed of vehicle (glycerin and propylene glycol mixture); vehicle 
and 2.0% nicotine; or vehicle, 2.0% nicotine and flavor mixture. Daily targeted 
aerosol total particulate matter (TPM) doses of 3.2, 9.6 and 32.0 mg/kg/day were 
achieved by exposure to 1 mg/L aerosol for 16, 48 and 160 min, respectively. 
Pre-study evaluations included indirect ophthalmoscopy, virology and 
bacteriological screening. Body weights, clinical observations and food 
consumption were monitored weekly. Plasma nicotine and cotinine and 
carboxyhemoglobin levels were measured at days 28 and 90. After days 28, 56 and 
90, lung function measurements were obtained. Biological endpoints after 90-day 
exposure and 42-day recovery period included clinical pathology, urinalysis, 
bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF) analysis, necropsy and histopathology. 
Treatment-related effects following 90 days of exposure included changes in body 
weight, food consumption and respiratory rate. Dose-related decreases in thymus 
and spleen weights, and increased BALF lactate dehydrogenase, total protein, 
alveolar macrophages, neutrophils and lung weights were observed. Histopathology 
evaluations revealed sporadic increases in nasal section 1-4 epithelial 
hyperplasia and vacuolization. Following the recovery period, effects in the 
nose and BALF were persistent while other effects were resolved. The no observed 
effect level based upon body weight decreases is considered to be the mid-dose 
level for each formulation, equivalent to a daily TPM exposure dose of 
approximately 9.6 mg/kg/day.

BACKGROUND: Electronic cigarettes (ECs) can influence nicotine addiction by 
delivering aerosolized nicotine. We investigated if nicotine from ECs is 
delivered to the brain β2*-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (β2*-nAChR) and how 
this relates to the behavioral effects and nicotine delivery from cigarettes.
METHODS: Seven nicotine users participated in positron emission tomography (PET) 
studies with (-)-[18F]Flubatine before and after nicotine challenge with 0, 8, 
and 36 mg/ml nicotine in a 3.3 Volt, 1.5 Ohm EC or a standard tobacco cigarette. 
Craving was evaluated before and after product use.
RESULTS: Average β2*-nAChR occupancy was higher after 36 mg/ml EC challenge 
compared to 8 mg/ml EC at trend level. Average β2*-nAChR occupancy after tobacco 
cigarette smoking was 68 ± 18% and was not different compared with 8 mg/ml (64 ± 
17%,) or 36 mg/ml (84 ± 3%) nicotine in EC users. Area under the curve (AUC) of 
blood nicotine level was higher in the cigarette smoking group compared with the 
8mg/ml group (p = 0.03), but similar compared with the 36 mg/ml EC (p = 0.29). 
Drug craving was reduced after use of the tobacco cigarette, 8 mg/ml EC, and 36 
mg/ml EC.
CONCLUSIONS: In this novel investigation of EC effects at β2*-nAChRs, we show 
that average β2*-nAChR occupancy was higher after 36 mg/ml EC challenge compared 
with 8 mg/ml EC. Receptor occupancy and arterial blood nicotine levels after 
cigarette smoking were similar to 36 mg/ml EC use under controlled conditions. 
These findings suggest that the ECs studied here have abuse liability and may 
provide an adequate alternative nicotine delivery system for cigarette smokers.
IMPLICATIONS: This is the first study to directly determine the neurologic 
effects of electronic cigarettes on human brain beta-2 nicotinic acetylcholine 
receptors using PET neuroimaging with (-)-[18F]Flubatine, a novel radiotracer. 
Our findings suggest that the e-cigarettes studied here have abuse liability and 
may provide an adequate alternative nicotine delivery system for cigarette 
smokers.

BACKGROUND: Smoking (TS) and recently e-cigarettes (EC) vaping, have been 
associated with vascular endothelial dysfunction primarily relevant to oxidative 
stress, exposure to nicotine, and smoking-induced inflammation. It is accepted 
that both EC and TS enhance glucose intolerance and the risk of developing 
type-2 diabetes mellitus which is also one of the causes of blood-brain barrier 
(BBB) damage and the higher risk of cerebrovascular diseases. Recent studies 
have shown how Metformin, the first common antidiabetic drug, can protect the 
BBB integrity through enhancement of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 
(Nrf2) activity. Herein, we investigated the role of rosiglitazone (RSG; family 
of thiazolidinedione class used oral anti-diabetic drug) in TS/EC-induced BBB 
impairment.
RESULTS: Although the exact mechanism of RSG is not fully understood, previous 
studies have revealed that RSG can promote counteractive protective mechanisms 
primarily associated with the enhancement of Nrf2 activity through activation of 
the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma. In line with these 
findings, our results show an increased expression of PPARy by RSG, enhancement 
of Nrf2 activity and BBB protection against TS/EC exposure including reduced 
inflammation, oxidative stress, tight junction downregulation and loss of BBB 
integrity.
CONCLUSIONS: RSG could be considered as a promising therapeutic potential to 
prevent TS/EC induced cerebrovascular dysfunction and possibly other xenobiotic 
substances which may impact the BBB via oxidative stress-mediated effects. 
However, additional in vivo studies and clinical setting will be needed to 
validate our results and assess the full extent of RSG protective effects.

Electronic cigarette refill liquids are commercially provided with a wide 
variety of flavoring agents. A recent study suggested that several common 
flavors may scavenge nitric oxide (NO) and cause endothelial dysfunction. It was 
the aim of the present study to investigate the effects of these flavors on 
NO/cyclic GMP-mediated signaling and vascular relaxation. We tested the 
flavoring agents for effects on Ca2+-induced cGMP accumulation and NO synthase 
activation in cultured endothelial cells. NO scavenging was studied with 
NO-activated soluble guanylate cyclase and as NO release from a NO donor, 
measured with a NO electrode. Blood vessel function was studied with 
precontracted rat aortic rings in the absence and presence of acetylcholine or a 
NO donor. Cinnamaldehyde inhibited Ca2+-stimulated endothelial cGMP accumulation 
and NO synthase activation at ≥0.3 mM. Cinnamaldehyde and diacetyl inhibited 
NO-activated soluble guanylate cyclase with IC50 values of 0.56 (0.54-0.58) and 
0.29 (0.24-0.36) mM, respectively, and caused moderate NO scavenging at 1 mM 
that was not mediated by superoxide anions. The other compounds did not scavenge 
NO at 1 mM. None of the flavorings interfered with acetylcholine-induced 
vascular relaxation, but they caused relaxation of pre-contracted aortas. The 
most potent compounds were eugenol and cinnamaldehyde with EC50 values of ~0.5 
mM. Since the flavors did not affect endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation, 
NO scavenging by cinnamaldehyde and diacetyl does not result in impaired blood 
vessel function. Although not studied in vivo, the low potency of the compounds 
renders it unlikely that the observed effects are relevant to humans inhaling 
flavored vapor from electronic cigarettes.

BACKGROUND: Although smoking cessation is currently the only guaranteed way to 
reduce the harm caused by tobacco smoking, a reasonable secondary tobacco 
control approach may be to try and reduce the harm from continued tobacco use 
amongst smokers unable or unwilling to quit. Possible approaches to reduce the 
exposure to toxins from smoking include reducing the amount of tobacco used, and 
using less toxic products, such as pharmaceutical, nicotine and potential 
reduced-exposure tobacco products (PREPs), as an alternative to cigarettes.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of interventions intended to reduce the harm 
to health of continued tobacco use, we considered the following specific 
questions: do interventions intended to reduce harm have an effect on long-term 
health status?; do they lead to a reduction in the number of cigarettes smoked?; 
do they have an effect on smoking abstinence?; do they have an effect on 
biomarkers of tobacco exposure?; and do they have an effect on biomarkers of 
damage caused by tobacco?
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Trials Register 
(CRS) on the 21st October 2015, using free-text and MeSH terms for harm 
reduction, smoking reduction and cigarette reduction.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials of 
interventions to reduce the amount smoked, or to reduce harm from smoking by 
means other than cessation. We include studies carried out in smokers with no 
immediate desire to quit all tobacco use. Primary outcomes were change in 
cigarette consumption, smoking cessation and any markers of damage or benefit to 
health, measured at least six months from the start of the intervention.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We assessed study eligibility for inclusion using 
standard Cochrane methods. We pooled trials with similar interventions and 
outcomes (> 50% reduction in cigarettes a day (CPD) and long-term smoking 
abstinence), using fixed-effect models. Where it was not possible to 
meta-analyse data, we summarized findings narratively.
MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-four trials evaluated interventions to help those who smoke 
to cut down the amount smoked or to replace their regular cigarettes with PREPs, 
compared to placebo, brief intervention, or a comparison intervention. None of 
these trials directly tested whether harm reduction strategies reduced the harms 
to health caused by smoking. Most trials (14/24) tested nicotine replacement 
therapy (NRT) as an intervention to assist reduction. In a pooled analysis of 
eight trials, NRT significantly increased the likelihood of reducing CPD by at 
least 50% for people using nicotine gum or inhaler or a choice of product 
compared to placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.44 to 
2.13; 3081 participants). Where average changes from baseline were compared for 
different measures, carbon monoxide (CO) and cotinine generally showed smaller 
reductions than CPD. Use of NRT versus placebo also significantly increased the 
likelihood of ultimately quitting smoking (RR 1.87, 95% CI 1.43 to 2.44; 8 
trials, 3081 participants; quality of the evidence: low). Two trials comparing 
NRT and behavioural support to brief advice found a significant effect on 
reduction, but no significant effect on cessation. We found one trial 
investigating each of the following harm reduction intervention aids: bupropion, 
varenicline, electronic cigarettes, snus, plus another of nicotine patches to 
facilitate temporary abstinence. The evidence for all five intervention types 
was therefore imprecise, and it is unclear whether or not these aids increase 
the likelihood of smoking reduction or cessation. Two trials investigating two 
different types of behavioural advice and instructions on reducing CPD also 
provided imprecise evidence. Therefore, the evidence base for this comparison is 
inadequate to support the use of these types of behavioural advice to reduce 
smoking. Four studies of PREPs (cigarettes with reduced levels of tar, carbon 
and nicotine, and in one case delivered using an electronically-heated cigarette 
smoking system) showed some reduction in exposure to some toxicants, but it is 
unclear whether this would substantially alter the risk of harm. We judged the 
included studies to be generally at a low or unclear risk of bias; however, 
there were some ratings of high risk, due to a lack of blinding and the 
potential for detection bias. Using the GRADE system, we rated the overall 
quality of the evidence for our cessation outcomes as 'low' or 'very low', due 
to imprecision and indirectness. A 'low' grade means that further research is 
very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of 
effect and is likely to change the estimate. A 'very low' grade means we are 
very uncertain about the estimate.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: People who do not wish to quit can be helped to cut down 
the number of cigarettes they smoke and to quit smoking in the long term, using 
NRT, despite original intentions not to do so. However, we rated the evidence 
contributing to the cessation outcome for NRT as 'low' by GRADE standards. There 
is a lack of evidence to support the use of other harm reduction aids to reduce 
the harm caused by continued tobacco smoking. This could simply be due to the 
lack of high-quality studies (our confidence in cessation outcomes for these 
aids is rated 'low' or 'very low' due to imprecision by GRADE standards), 
meaning that we may have missed a worthwhile effect, or due to a lack of effect 
on reduction or quit rates. It is therefore important that more high-quality 
RCTs are conducted, and that these also measure the long-term health effects of 
treatments.

Endothelial cell migration is a critical process in the maintenance of healthy 
blood vessels. Impaired endothelial migration is reportedly associated with the 
development of cardiovascular diseases. Here, we report on the development of a 
96-well in vitro endothelial migration assay for the purpose of comparative 
toxicological assessment of a novel THP relative to cigarette smoke, to be able 
to rapidly inform regulatory decision making. Uniform scratches were induced in 
confluent human umbilical vein endothelial cells using the 96-pin wound maker 
and exposed to 3R4F cigarette or THP aqueous extracts (AqE). Endothelial 
migration was recorded over 24 h, and the rate of wound closure calculated using 
mean relative wound density rather than migration rate as previously reported. 
This self-normalising parameter accounts for starting wound size, by comparing 
the density of the scratch to the outer region at each time-point. Furthermore, 
wound width acceptance criteria was defined to further increase the sensitivity 
of the assay. 3R4F and THP AqE samples were tested at comparable nicotine 
concentrations. 3R4F showed significant cytotoxicity and inhibition of wound 
healing whereas THP AqE did not show any response in either endpoint. This 
96-well endothelial migration assay was suitably sensitive to distinguish 
combustible cigarette and THP test articles.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the risk factors of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome 
(MODS) in severe trauma patients, put forward a new warning scoring system of 
MODS, and to provide a more accurate scoring method for doctors to judge the 
clinical condition and prognosis of patients.
METHODS: Clinical data of 342 patients with severe trauma admitted to intensive 
care unit (ICU) of the Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical College and Daping 
Hospital of the Third Military Medical University from January 1st, 2015 to 
December 31st, 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were divided 
into MODS groups (n = 251) and non-MODS group (n = 91) according to clinical 
outcomes. The clinical data of patients, including gender, age, heart rate (HR) 
and blood pressure within 24 hours after admission to the hospital, indicators 
of blood routine and blood biochemistry, severity of disease, severity of 
trauma, whether received the emergency intubation or surgery within 24 hours or 
not, whether developed sepsis or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 
during hospitalization, were recorded, and univariate analysis was conducted. 
The indicators with statistical significance found by univariate analysis were 
enrolled in multivariate Logistic regression analysis, and the risk factors for 
MODS in patients with severe trauma were screened and assigned, and the final 
total score was MODS warning score. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
curve was plotted to evaluate MODS warning score for predicting the occurrence 
of MODS in patients with severe trauma.
RESULTS: Compared with non-MODS group, HR, Na+, serum creatinine (SCr), 
activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), injury severity score (ISS), new 
injury severity score (NISS), acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II 
(APACHE II) score and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score in MODS 
group were significantly increased, pH value, red blood cell (RBC), platelet 
(PLT), albumin (Alb) and Glasgow coma score (GCS) were remarkably decreased, and 
multiple injury, the patients with shock at admission, blood transfusion, 
central venous catheter, emergency intubation and infection were also increased, 
and more patients suffered from sepsis and ARDS. Multivariate Logistic 
regression analysis showed that the number of injured places equal or more than 
2, shock at admission, APACHE II score ≥ 15, SOFA score ≥ 4 and APTT > 40 s were 
risk factors for MODS in patients with severe trauma, with total MODS warning 
score of 7.5. ROC curve analysis showed that the area under ROC curve (AUC) of 
MODS warning score for predicting MODS in patients with severe trauma was 0.822, 
which was significantly higher than that of APACHE II score (AUC = 0.698, P < 
0.001), APTT (AUC = 0.693, P < 0.001) and SOFA score (AUC = 0.770, P = 0.025). 
When the cut-off value of MODS warning score was 2.5, the sensitivity was 
61.35%, the specificity was 90.11%, and Youden index was 0.515.
CONCLUSIONS: MODS warning score is composed of five factors, including the 
number of injured places, shock at admission, APACHE II score, SOFA score and 
APTT, which could be regarded as early warning score system for predicting MODS 
in patients with severe trauma. MODS warning score can be more comprehensive and 
timely to assess the possibility of MODS and prognosis of patients with severe 
trauma, and the prediction result is better than the single use of APTT, APACHE 
II or SOFA score.

Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling can be a useful tool for 
characterizing nicotine pharmacokinetics (PK) from use of tobacco products. We 
expand a previously published PBPK model to simulate a nicotine PK profile, 
following single or multiple use of various tobacco products [cigarettes, 
smokeless tobacco, and electronic nicotine delivery systems, or a nicotine 
inhaler (NICOTROL)] The uptake route in the model was designed to allow for 
three uptake compartments: buccal cavity (BC), upper respiratory tract (URT) 
(conducting and transitional airways) and lower respiratory tract (alveolar 
region). Within each region, the model includes product-specific descriptions of 
the flux of nicotine into plasma, as well as the flux of nicotine from the BC 
and URT to the gastrointestinal tract. These descriptions are based on regional 
deposition and diffusion models of nicotine into plasma, which depends on the 
product type. Regional deposition flux combined with regional differences in 
physiological parameters (e.g., blood perfusion ratio and tissue thickness) play 
a key role in the product-specific PK profile of nicotine. The current model 
describes the slower flux of nicotine into plasma across the BC and URT, as well 
as the rapid flux known to occur in the alveolar region. Overall, the addition 
of the BC and respiratory tract compartments to the nicotine model provided 
simulation results that are comparable to the nicotine time-course plasma 
concentrations reported from clinical studies for the four product categories 
simulated.

E-cigarette flavored pods are increasing in use among young adults. Although 
marketed as a safer alternative to conventional cigarettes, the health effects 
of e-cigarette flavored pods are unknown. We hypothesized that e-cigarette 
flavored pods would cause oxidative stress, barrier dysfunction, and an 
inflammatory response in monocytes and lung epithelial cells. JUUL pod flavors 
(Fruit Medley, Virginia Tobacco, Cool Mint, Crème Brulee, Cool Cucumber, Mango, 
and Classic Menthol) and similar pod flavors (Just Mango-Strawberry Coconut and 
Caffé Latte) were tested. These pod flavors generated significant amounts of 
acellular ROS and induced significant mitochondrial superoxide production in 
bronchial epithelial cells (16-HBE). Lung epithelial cells (16-HBE, BEAS-2B) and 
monocytes (U937) exposed to various pod aerosols resulted in increased 
inflammatory mediators, such as IL-8 or PGE2. JUUL pod flavors, Crème Brulee and 
Cool Cucumber, caused epithelial barrier dysfunction in 16-HBE cells. Moreover, 
tested flavors also showed DNA damage upon exposure in monocytes. We determined 
the chemical constituents present in various flavors. Our data suggest that 
these constituents in flavored pods induce oxidative stress, inflammation, 
epithelial barrier dysfunction, and DNA damage in lung cells. These data provide 
insights into the regulation of e-cigarette flavored pods, as well as 
constituents in these flavors.

The use of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), also known as 
e-cigarettes, with a variety of e-liquids/e-juices, is increasing at an alarming 
rate among adolescents who do not realize the potential harmful health effects. 
This study examines the harmful effects of ENDS on the liver. Apolipoprotein E 
null (ApoE-/-) mice on a western diet (WD) were exposed to saline or ENDS with 
2.4% nicotine aerosol for 12 weeks using our mouse ENDS exposure model system, 
which delivers nicotine to mice and leads to equivalent serum cotinine levels 
found in human cigarette users. ApoE-/- mice on a WD exposed to ENDS exhibited a 
marked increase in hepatic lipid accumulation compared with ApoE-/- on a similar 
diet exposed to saline aerosol. The detrimental effects of ENDS on hepatic 
steatosis were associated with significantly greater oxidative stress, increased 
hepatic triglyceride levels, and increased hepatocyte apoptosis, independent of 
adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase signaling. In addition, hepatic 
RNA sequencing analysis revealed that 433 genes were differentially expressed in 
ENDS-exposed mice on WD compared with saline-exposed mice. Functional analysis 
indicates that genes associated with lipid metabolism, cholesterol biosynthesis, 
and circadian rhythm were most significantly altered in the liver in response to 
ENDS. Conclusion: These results demonstrate profound adverse effects of ENDS on 
the liver. This is important information for regulatory agencies as they 
regulate ENDS.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether biomarkers of exposure (BoE) 
and potential harm (BoPH) are modified when smokers switch from smoking 
cigarettes to exclusive use of a tobacco heating product (THP) in an ambulatory 
setting. Participants in this randomised, controlled study were healthy 
volunteer smokers assigned either to continue smoking or switch to a THP, and a 
control group of smokers who abstained from cigarette smoking. Various BoE and 
BoPH related to oxidative stress, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, and 
cancer were assessed at baseline and up to 180 days. In continuing smokers, BoE 
and BoPH remained stable between baseline and day 180, while THP users' levels 
of most BoE reduced significantly, becoming similar to those in controls 
abstaining from cigarette smoking. Also at 180 days, significant changes in 
numerous BoPH, including total 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol, 
8-epi-prostaglandin F2α type III, fractional concentration of exhaled nitric 
oxide and white blood cell count, were directionally consistent with lessened 
health impact. Our findings support the notion that the deleterious health 
impacts of cigarette smoking may be reduced in smokers who completely switch to 
using THPs.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The review highlights selected studies related to 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention that were presented at the American 
College of Cardiology 2020 Virtual Scientific Session (ACC.20)/World Cardiology 
Congress (WCC).
RECENT FINDINGS: The studies reviewed include clinical trials on the efficacy 
and safety of alirocumab (Study in Participants with Homozygous Familial 
Hypercholesterolemia [ODYSSEY HoFH]) and evinacumab in the treatment of 
homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH); Evaluating the Efficacy of 
E-cigarettes for Smoking Cessation (E3); the use of renal denervation in the 
treatment of hypertension (SPYRAL HTN-OFF MED PIVOTAL); and the assessment of 
vericiguat in the treatment of heart failure (A Study of Vericiguat in 
Participants with Heart Failure with Reduce Ejection Fraction [VICTORIA]). In 
addition, results from the pooled analysis of phase III trials on inclisiran and 
secondary analysis examining eicosapentaenoic acid levels and cardiovascular 
outcomes from the Reduction of Cardiovascular Events with Icosapent 
Ethyl-Intervention Trial (REDUCE-IT) were included. Finally, we discuss studies 
examining the use of polygenic risk score with low density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (LDL-C) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) on lifetime cardiovascular 
risk. The studies presented at the ACC.20/WCC represent notable contributions in 
the field of CVD prevention.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Cogent arguments have been made against the need for 
biochemical verification in population-based studies with low-demand 
characteristics. Despite this fact, studies involving digital interventions 
(low-demand) are often required in peer review to report biochemically verified 
abstinence. To address this discrepancy, we examined the feasibility and costs 
of biochemical verification in a web-based study conducted with a national 
sample.
METHODS: Participants were 600U.S. adult current smokers who registered on a 
web-based smoking cessation program and completed surveys at baseline and 
3months. Saliva sampling kits were sent to participants who reported 7-day 
abstinence at 3months, and analyzed for cotinine.
RESULTS: The response rate at 3-months was 41.2% (n=247): 93 participants 
reported 7-day abstinence (38%) and were mailed a saliva kit (71% returned). The 
discordance rate was 36.4%. Participants with discordant responses were more 
likely to report 3-month use of nicotine replacement therapy or e-cigarettes 
than those with concordant responses (79.2% vs. 45.2%, p=0.007). The total cost 
of saliva sampling was $8280 ($125/sample).
CONCLUSIONS: Biochemical verification was both time- and cost-intensive, and 
yielded a relatively small number of samples due to low response rates and use 
of other nicotine products during the follow-up period. There was a high rate of 
discordance of self-reported abstinence and saliva testing. Costs for data 
collection may be prohibitive for studies with large sample sizes or limited 
budgets. Our findings echo previous statements that biochemical verification is 
not necessary in population-based studies, and add evidence specific to 
technology-based studies.

IMPORTANCE: Cannabis use has been associated with increased crash risk, but the 
effect of cannabidiol (CBD) on driving is unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the driving impairment caused by vaporized cannabis 
containing Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and CBD.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A double-blind, within-participants, 
randomized clinical trial was conducted at the Faculty of Psychology and 
Neuroscience at Maastricht University in the Netherlands between May 20, 2019, 
and March 27, 2020. Participants (N = 26) were healthy occasional users of 
cannabis.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants vaporized THC-dominant, CBD-dominant, 
THC/CBD-equivalent, and placebo cannabis. THC and CBD doses were 13.75 mg. Order 
of conditions was randomized and balanced.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was standard deviation of 
lateral position (SDLP; a measure of lane weaving) during 100 km, on-road 
driving tests that commenced at 40 minutes and 240 minutes after cannabis 
consumption. At a calibrated blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.02%, SDLP 
was increased relative to placebo by 1.12 cm, and at a calibrated BAC of 0.05%, 
SDLP was increased relative to placebo by 2.4 cm.
RESULTS: Among 26 randomized participants (mean [SD] age, 23.2 [2.6] years; 16 
women), 22 (85%) completed all 8 driving tests. At 40 to 100 minutes following 
consumption, the SDLP was 18.21 cm with CBD-dominant cannabis, 20.59 cm with 
THC-dominant cannabis, 21.09 cm with THC/CBD-equivalent cannabis, and 18.28 cm 
with placebo cannabis. SDLP was significantly increased by THC-dominant cannabis 
(+2.33 cm [95% CI, 0.80 to 3.86]; P < .001) and THC/CBD-equivalent cannabis 
(+2.83 cm [95% CI, 1.28 to 4.39]; P < .001) but not CBD-dominant cannabis (-0.05 
cm [95% CI, -1.49 to 1.39]; P > .99), relative to placebo. At 240 to 300 minutes 
following consumption, the SDLP was 19.03 cm with CBD-dominant cannabis, 19.88 
cm with THC-dominant cannabis, 20.59 cm with THC/CBD-equivalent cannabis, and 
19.37 cm with placebo cannabis. The SDLP did not differ significantly in the CBD 
(-0.34 cm [95% CI, -1.77 to 1.10]; P > .99), THC (0.51 cm [95% CI, -1.01 to 
2.02]; P > .99) or THC/CBD (1.22 cm [95% CI, -0.29 to 2.72]; P = .20) 
conditions, relative to placebo. Out of 188 test drives, 16 (8.5%) were 
terminated due to safety concerns.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In a crossover clinical trial that assessed driving 
performance during on-road driving tests, the SDLP following vaporized 
THC-dominant and THC/CBD-equivalent cannabis compared with placebo was 
significantly greater at 40 to 100 minutes but not 240 to 300 minutes after 
vaporization; there were no significant differences between CBD-dominant 
cannabis and placebo. However, the effect size for CBD-dominant cannabis may not 
have excluded clinically important impairment, and the doses tested may not 
represent common usage.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Electronic cigarette (E-cigarettes) emissions present a 
potentially new hazard to neonates through inhalation, dermal and oral contact. 
Exposure to nicotine containing E-cigarettes may cause significant systemic 
absorption in neonates due to the potential for multi-route exposure. Systemic 
absorption of nicotine and constituents of E-cigarette emissions may adversely 
impact weight and lung development in the neonate. To address these questions we 
exposed neonatal mice to E-cigarette emissions and measured systemic cotinine 
levels and alveolar lung growth.
METHODS/MAIN RESULTS: Neonatal mice were exposed to E-cigarettes for the first 
10 days of life. E-cigarette cartridges contained either 1.8% nicotine in 
propylene glycol (PG) or PG vehicle alone. Daily weights, plasma and urine 
cotinine levels and lung growth using the alveolar mean linear intercept (MLI) 
method were measured at 10 days of life and compared to room air controls. Mice 
exposed to 1.8% nicotine/PG had a 13.3% decrease in total body weight compared 
to room air controls. Plasma cotinine levels were found to be elevated in 
neonatal mice exposed to 1.8% nicotine/PG E-cigarettes (mean 62.34± 3.3 ng/ml). 
After adjusting for sex and weight, the nicotine exposed mice were found to have 
modestly impaired lung growth by MLI compared to room air control mice (p<.054 
trial 1; p<.006 trial 2). These studies indicate that exposure to E-cigarette 
emissions during the neonatal period can adversely impact weight gain. In 
addition exposure to nicotine containing E-cigarettes can cause detectable 
levels of systemic cotinine, diminished alveolar cell proliferation and a modest 
impairment in postnatal lung growth.

BACKGROUND: The vascular safety of electronic cigarettes (e-Cigarettes) must 
still be clarified. We compared the impact of e-Cigarettes vs traditional 
tobacco cigarettes on oxidative stress and endothelial function in healthy 
smokers and nonsmoker adults.
METHODS: A crossover, single-blind study was performed in 40 healthy subjects 
(20 smokers and 20 nonsmokers, matched for age and sex). First, all subjects 
smoked traditional tobacco cigarettes. One week later, the same subjects smoked 
an e-Cigarette with the same nominal nicotine content. Blood samples were drawn 
just before and after smoking, and markers of oxidative stress, nitric oxide 
bioavailability, and vitamin E levels were measured. Flow-mediated dilation 
(FMD) was also measured.
RESULTS: Smoking both e-Cigarettes and traditional cigarettes led to a 
significant increase in the levels of soluble NOX2-derived peptide and 
8-iso-prostaglandin F2α and a significant decrease in nitric oxide 
bioavailability, vitamin E levels, and FMD. Generalized estimating equation 
analysis confirmed that all markers of oxidative stress and FMD were 
significantly affected by smoking and showed that the biologic effects of 
e-Cigarettes vstraditional cigarettes on vitamin E levels (P = .413) and FMD 
(P = .311) were not statistically different. However, e-Cigarettes seemed to 
have a lesser impact than traditional cigarettes on levels of soluble 
NOX2-derived peptide (P = .001), 8-iso-prostaglandin F2α (P = .046), and nitric 
oxide bioavailability (P = .001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that both cigarettes have unfavorable effects on 
markers of oxidative stress and FMD after single use, although e-Cigarettes 
seemed to have a lesser impact. Future studies are warranted to clarify the 
chronic vascular effects of e-Cigarette smoking.

We investigated the effects of vegetable glycerin (VG), a main e-cigarette 
constituent, on endotoxin-induced acute lung injury (ALI). Mice received 
intratracheal administration of 30% VG in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) 
vehicle or only PBS (control) for 4 days. On Day 5, mice received an 
intratracheal instillation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (LPS group and VG + LPS 
group) or PBS (VG group and control group). Lung histopathology, expression of 
chemokine receptors, and regulatory signaling were analyzed 24 h after the Day 5 
treatment. VG significantly increased ALI-associated histopathological and 
fibrotic changes in both the VG group and LPS-induced ALI mice (VG + LPS group). 
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and western blot analyses revealed that VG 
administration resulted in upregulation of neutrophil markers [lymphocyte 
antigen 6 complex locus G6D (Ly6G) and myeloperoxidase (MPO)] as well as 
upregulation of the expression of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), a 
central mediator of fibrogenesis, in the lungs of both VG and VG + LPS groups. 
VG enhanced the expression of adhesion molecules [very late antigen 4 (VLA-4) 
and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1)] and increased activation of p38 
mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) to prompt neutrophil recruitment in 
the lungs of mice with ALI. Intraperitoneal administration of a p38 inhibitor 
attenuated these histopathological changes significantly as well as VG-induced 
upregulation in expression of Ly6G, MPO, VLA-4, VCAM-1, TGF-β, and collagen-1 in 
mice with ALI. In conclusion, VG enhances neutrophil chemotaxis and fibrosis and 
it amplifies the inflammatory response associated with LPS-induced ALI in the 
lungs via enhancement of p38 MAPK activity.

A working group (WG) of experts from diverse fields related to nicotine and 
tobacco addiction was constituted to identify constructs and measures for the 
PhenX (Phenotypes and eXposures) Tobacco Regulatory Research (TRR) Host: 
Biobehavioral Collection with potential relevance to users of both conventional 
and newer tobacco products. This paper describes the methods and results the WG 
used to identify, select, approve and place measures in the PhenX TRR 
Collection. The WG recognised 13 constructs of importance to guide their 
categorisation of measures already in the PhenX Toolkit ('complementary 
measures') and to identify novel or improved measures of special relevance to 
tobacco regulatory science. In addition to the 22 complementary measures of 
relevance to tobacco use already in the PhenX Toolkit, the WG identified and 
recommended nine additional Host: Biobehavioral measures characterising the use, 
exposure and health outcomes of tobacco products for application to TRR. Of 
these, five were self-administered or interviewer-administered measures: amount, 
type and frequency of recent tobacco use; flavor preference in e-cigarette users 
(adult and youth); pregnancy status and tobacco use; pregnancy status-mother and 
baby health and withdrawal from tobacco use. The remaining four measures were 
laboratory-based: cotinine in serum, expired carbon monoxide, 
4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol in urine and cue reactivity. 
Although a number of validated tools are now available in the Host: 
Biobehavioral Collection, several gaps were identified, including a need to 
develop and test the identified measures in adolescent samples and to develop or 
identify measures of nicotine dependence, tolerance and withdrawal associated 
with newer non-combusted tobacco products.

The pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of nicotine delivered by an Electronic Vapour 
Product (EVP) was characterised in a 2-part study in smokers. The study was 
designed as a randomised, controlled, four-way crossover trial. Part 1 compared 
an unflavoured e-liquid (UF2.0%) and a flavoured e-liquid (FL2.0%) to a 
conventional cigarette (CC; JPS Silver King Size, 0.6 mg) and a licensed 
nicotine inhalator (Nicorette(®); 15 mg). Part 2 compared e-liquids with 
increasing nicotine concentrations (0%, 0.4%, 0.9%, 2.0%). Subjects used each 
different product for a daily use session. In Part 1, maximum plasma nicotine 
concentration (Cmax) for UF2.0%, FL2.0%, Nicorette(®) and CC was 3.6, 2.5, 2.5 
and 21.2 ng/mL, respectively. The time to maximum plasma nicotine concentration 
(Tmax) was longer for the EVP (UF2.0%, 9.0 min; FL2.0%, 10.0 min) and the 
nicotine inhalator (13.0 min) compared to CC (3.0 min). In Part 2, EVP with 0%, 
0.4%, 0.9% and 2.0% nicotine produced Cmax values of 0.6, 1.0, 1.9 and 
3.6 ng/mL, respectively. At the maximum nicotine concentration of 2% as 
prescribed by the European Tobacco Directive, the EVP achieved nicotine delivery 
that was comparable to the inhalator. EVPs thus offer a potential alternative to 
nicotine inhalator devices for those finding it difficult to quit smoking.

OBJECTIVE: This double-blind, placebo controlled study examined whether menthol 
inhaled from an electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) would change subjective and 
withdrawal alleviating effects of intravenous nicotine in young adult smokers.
METHODS: A total of 32 menthol-preferring smokers and 25 non-menthol-preferring 
smokers participated in the study that consisted of a random sequence of three 
different inhaled menthol conditions (0.0%, 0.5%, and 3.2%) across three test 
sessions (a single menthol condition per session). In each test session 
(performed at least 24 hours apart), a random order of saline, and two different 
nicotine infusions of 0.25 mg and 0.5 mg/70 kg of bodyweight were administered, 
one hour apart, concurrent with menthol inhalation.
RESULTS: While menthol did not alter the positive subjective effects of 
nicotine, menthol significantly enhanced aversive effects of nicotine in 
non-menthol-preferring smokers and reduced smoking urges in menthol-preferring 
smokers. In addition, menthol-preferring smokers reported blunted positive 
subjective responses to nicotine and less severe nicotine withdrawal after 
overnight nicotine deprivation. Finally, compared to non-menthol-preferring 
smokers, menthol-preferring smokers had a significantly lower baseline nicotine 
metabolite ratio indicating slower nicotine metabolism within our sample of 
menthol-preferring smokers.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings did not support an enhancement of nicotine's positive 
subjective effects from inhaled menthol. However, as compared to 
non-menthol-preferring smokers, menthol-preferring smokers had blunted positive 
subjective responses to nicotine and reduced overnight withdrawal severity that 
may be partly due to inhibition of nicotine metabolism from chronic exposure to 
inhaled menthol. Collectively, these results reveal a more complex and nuanced 
role of inhaled menthol in smokers than previously recognized.

AIMS: To measure the systemic retention of nicotine, propylene glycol (PG) and 
vegetable glycerin (VG) in electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) users, and assess 
the abuse liability of e-cigarettes by characterizing nicotine pharmacokinetics.
DESIGN: E-cigarette users recruited over the internet participated in a 1-day 
research ward study. Subjects took 15 puffs from their usual brand of 
e-cigarette. Exhaled breath was trapped in gas-washing bottles and blood was 
sampled before and several times after use.
SETTING: San Francisco, California, USA.
PARTICIPANTS: Thirteen healthy, experienced adult e-cigarette users (six females 
and seven males).
MEASUREMENTS: Plasma nicotine was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass 
spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) and nicotine, VG and PG in e-liquids and gas traps were 
analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Heart rate changes and subjective effects were assessed.
FINDINGS: E-cigarettes delivered an average of 1.33 (0.87-1.79) mg [mean and 95% 
confidence interval (CI)] of nicotine, and 93.8% of the inhaled dose, 1.22 
(0.80-1.66) was systemically retained. Average maximum plasma nicotine 
concentration (Cmax ) was 8.4 (5.4-11.5) ng/ml and time of maximal concentration 
(Tmax ) was 2-5 minutes. One participant had Tmax of 30 minutes. 84.4% and 91.7% 
of VG and PG, respectively, was systemically retained. Heart rate increased by 
an average of 8.0 beats per minute after 5 minutes. Withdrawal and urge to smoke 
decreased and the e-cigarettes were described as satisfying.
CONCLUSIONS: E-cigarettes can deliver levels of nicotine that are comparable to 
or higher than typical tobacco cigarettes, with similar systemic retention. 
Although the average maximum plasma nicotine concentration in experienced 
e-cigarette users appears to be generally lower than what has been reported from 
tobacco cigarette use, the shape of the pharmacokinetic curve is similar, 
suggesting addictive potential.

Electronic (e)-cigarette use is rapidly rising, with 20 % of Americans ages 
25-44 now using these drug delivery devices. E-cigarette users expose their 
airways, cells of host defense, and colonizing bacteria to e-cigarette vapor 
(EV). Here, we report that exposure of human epithelial cells at the air-liquid 
interface to fresh EV (vaped from an e-cigarette device) resulted in 
dose-dependent cell death. After exposure to EV, cells of host 
defense-epithelial cells, alveolar macrophages, and neutrophils-had reduced 
antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus (SA). Mouse inhalation of 
EV for 1 h daily for 4 weeks led to alterations in inflammatory markers within 
the airways and elevation of an acute phase reactant in serum. Upon exposure to 
e-cigarette vapor extract (EVE), airway colonizer SA had increased biofilm 
formation, adherence and invasion of epithelial cells, resistance to human 
antimicrobial peptide LL-37, and up-regulation of virulence genes. EVE-exposed 
SA were more virulent in a mouse model of pneumonia. These data suggest that 
e-cigarettes may be toxic to airway cells, suppress host defenses, and promote 
inflammation over time, while also promoting virulence of colonizing bacteria.
KEY MESSAGE: Acute exposure to e-cigarette vapor (EV) is cytotoxic to airway 
cells in vitro. Acute exposure to EV decreases macrophage and neutrophil 
antimicrobial function. Inhalation of EV alters immunomodulating cytokines in 
the airways of mice. Inhalation of EV leads to increased markers of inflammation 
in BAL and serum. Staphylococcus aureus become more virulent when exposed to EV.

INTRODUCTION: Cyanoethyl mercapturic acid (CEMA) is a urinary metabolite of 
acrylonitrile, a toxicant found in substantial quantities in cigarette smoke, 
but not in non-combusted products such as e-cigarettes or smokeless tobacco and 
rarely in the diet or in the general human environment. Thus, we hypothesized 
that CEMA is an excellent biomarker of combusted tobacco product use.
AIMS AND METHODS: We tested this hypothesis by analyzing CEMA in the urine of 
1259 cigarette smokers (urinary cotinine ≥25 ng/mL) and 1191 nonsmokers. The 
analyses of CEMA and cotinine were performed by validated liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry methods. Logistic regression was fit for 
log-transformed CEMA to construct the receiver operating characteristic curve.
RESULTS: We found that a CEMA cutpoint of 27 pmol/mL urine differentiated 
cigarette smokers from nonsmokers with sensitivity and specificity greater than 
99%. The use of different cotinine cutpoints to define smokers (10-30 ng/mL) had 
little effect on the results.
CONCLUSIONS: CEMA is a highly reliable urinary biomarker to identify users of 
combusted tobacco products such as cigarettes as opposed to users of 
non-combusted products, medicinal nicotine, or nonusers of tobacco products.
IMPLICATIONS: CEMA can be used to distinguish users of combusted tobacco 
products from non-combusted products such as e-cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, 
and medicinal nicotine. Levels of CEMA in the urine of people who use these 
non-combusted products are extremely low, in contrast to cotinine.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Secondhand smoke (SHS) directly increases exposure to 
airborne nicotine, tobacco's main psychoactive substance. When exposed to SHS, 
nonsmokers inhale 60% to 80% of airborne nicotine, absorb concentrations similar 
to those absorbed by smokers, and display high levels of nicotine biomarkers. 
Social modeling, or observing other smokers, is a well-established predictor of 
smoking during adolescence. Observing smokers also leads to increased 
pharmacological exposure to airborne nicotine via SHS. The objective of this 
study is to investigate whether greater exposure to airborne nicotine via SHS 
increases the risk for smoking initiation precursors among never-smoking 
adolescents.
METHODS: Secondary students (N = 406; never-smokers: n = 338, 53% girls, mean 
age = 12.9, SD = 0.4) participated in the AdoQuest II longitudinal cohort. They 
answered questionnaires about social exposure to smoking (parents, siblings, 
peers) and known smoking precursors (eg, expected benefits and/or costs, SHS 
aversion, smoking susceptibility, and nicotine dependence symptoms). Saliva and 
hair samples were collected to derive biomarkers of cotinine and nicotine. 
Adolescents wore a passive monitor for 1 week to measure airborne nicotine.
RESULTS: Higher airborne nicotine was significantly associated with greater 
expected benefits (R2 = 0.024) and lower expected costs (R2 = 0.014). Higher 
social exposure was significantly associated with more temptation to try smoking 
(R2 = 0.025), lower aversion to SHS (R2 = 0.038), and greater smoking 
susceptibility (R2 = 0.071). Greater social exposure was significantly 
associated with more nicotine dependence symptoms; this relation worsened with 
higher nicotine exposure (cotinine R2 = 0.096; airborne nicotine R2 = 0.088).
CONCLUSIONS: Airborne nicotine exposure via SHS is a plausible risk factor for 
smoking initiation during adolescence. Public health implications include 
limiting airborne nicotine through smoking bans in homes and cars, in addition 
to stringent restrictions for e-cigarettes.

We report on the development of an ultra-performance liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method for simultaneously 
measuring eight biomarkers of volatile organic compound (VOC) exposure, with 
potential application to e-cigarette aerosol biomonitoring. Phenylmercapturic 
acid (PMA) and trans, trans-muconic acid (tt-MA) are metabolites of benzene; 
2-aminothiazoline-4-carboxylic acid (ATCA) is a metabolite of cyanide; 
N-2-furoylglycine (N2FG) is a metabolite of furfural and furfuryl alcohol; 
5-hydroxymethylfuroic acid (HMFA), 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furoylglycine (HMFG), and 
2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) are metabolites of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural; 
and 5-hydroxy-N-methylpyrrolidone (5HMP) is a metabolite of 
N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone. A pentafluorophenyl-modified silica column was used for 
chromatographic separation. The overall run time for the method is about 6 min 
per sample injection. The method has low to sub-nanograms per milliliter 
sensitivity, linearity over 3 orders of magnitude, and precision and accuracy 
within 15%. The method was used to measure human urine samples. Results showed 
that people with known benzene exposure (daily cigarette smokers) had higher 
levels of tt-MA and PMA compared with non-smokers. The method is advantageous 
for high-throughput analysis of selected VOC metabolites in large-scale, 
population-based studies such as the National Health and Nutrition Examination 
Survey (NHANES). Quantifying these urinary biomarkers is important to public 
health efforts to understand human exposure to VOCs from various sources, 
including tobacco products and electronic nicotine delivery systems.

INTRODUCTION: Multi-site tobacco cessation trials could benefit from remote 
biochemical verification for tobacco use without invasive, time-consuming, or 
expensive collection processes. To the authors' knowledge, there have been no 
previous studies examining the predictive validity of oral fluid swabs for the 
detection of cotinine levels with samples collected off-site and mailed for 
on-site interpretation.
METHODS: Tobacco users were recruited through an online survey and participants 
who met the initial eligibility criteria were invited to take part. Those who 
elected to enroll provided two positive iScreen Oral Fluid Device (OFD) cotinine 
test samples during an in-office visit. One sample was used as a control and 
stored in a temperature-regulated location, while the other was mailed from one 
of ten surrounding counties. Mailing method and time from collection to mailing 
were varied, and results were assessed against control samples.
RESULTS: Twenty tobacco users enrolled in the study. Participants ranged in age 
from 18 to 31 (M = 16.45, SD = 1.54). Several types of tobacco use were 
reported, with electronic cigarettes the most commonly reported product. None of 
the mailed sample interpretations changed from pre- to post-mailing, with up to 
twenty-one days from sample collection to results confirmation.
CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that the use of mailed oral swabs may be an easy 
to use, reliable, and low-cost option for the detection of cotinine in tobacco 
users when in-person collection is not feasible. Test result interpretations 
were found to be unchanged after mailing, and after extended post-collection 
time gaps.

In this preliminary study, we have investigated whether dermal uptake of 
nicotine directly from air or indirectly from clothing can be a meaningful 
exposure pathway. Two participants wearing only shorts and a third participant 
wearing clean cotton clothes were exposed to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), 
generated by mechanically "smoking" cigarettes, for three hours in a chamber 
while breathing clean air from head-enveloping hoods. The average nicotine 
concentration (420 μg/m3 ) was comparable to the highest levels reported for 
smoking sections of pubs. Urine samples were collected immediately before 
exposure and 60 hour post-exposure for bare-skinned participants. For the 
clothed participant, post-exposure urine samples were collected for 24 hour. 
This participant then entered the chamber for another three-hour exposure 
wearing a hood and clothes, including a shirt that had been exposed for five 
days to elevated nicotine levels. The urine samples were analyzed for nicotine 
and two metabolites-cotinine and 3OH-cotinine. Peak urinary cotinine and 
3OH-cotinine concentrations for the bare-skinned participants were comparable to 
levels measured among non-smokers in hospitality environments before smoking 
bans. The amount of dermally absorbed nicotine for each bare-skinned participant 
was conservatively estimated at 570 μg, but may have been larger. For the 
participant wearing clean clothes, uptake was ~20 μg, and while wearing a shirt 
previously exposed to nicotine, uptake was ~80 μg. This study demonstrates 
meaningful dermal uptake of nicotine directly from air or from nicotine-exposed 
clothes. The findings are especially relevant for children in homes with smoking 
or vaping.

Different effects of smoking or use of smokeless tobacco on platelet MAO-B 
activity in type 1 alcohol-dependent subjects.

SE-405 30 Göteborg, Sweden.

BACKGROUND: Low platelet monoamine oxidase (MAO)-B activity has been proposed as 
a marker for alcohol-dependence. Findings are, however, contradictory and the 
influence of confounding factors have been thoroughly investigated. Thus, it is 
now well established that cigarette smoking reduces platelet MAO-activity. 
However, not much is known about the influence of smokeless tobacco, i.e. snuff 
or chewing tobacco, on platelet MAO-B activity. The aim of the present study was 
to compare platelet MAO-B activity in type 1 alcohol-dependent subjects with 
concomitant use of smokeless tobacco (i.e. snuff users), use of smoking tobacco 
(i.e. cigarette smokers), and in those without any tobacco use.
METHODS: Platelet MAO-B activity was examined in three groups of 
alcohol-dependent subjects: snuff users (n = 14), cigarette smokers (n = 33), 
and non-tobacco users (N = 46).
RESULTS: In the alcohol-dependent subjects concomitant cigarette smokers, but 
not snuff users, were found to have significantly lower platelet MAO-B activity 
as compared to non-tobacco users (platelet MAO-B activity 4.0 +/- 1.5, 5.1 +/- 
1.5 and 5.0 +/- 1.9 microkat/kg protein, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: The findings in the present study suggests that in the 
alcohol-dependent subjects the concomitant use of smokeless tobacco, i.e. 
snuffing, does not have an inhibitory effect on platelet MAO-B activity. This 
may have implications for future research. Thus, alcohol-dependent subjects with 
concomitant tobacco use should be grouped separately according to the form of 
the tobacco used, i.e. smoking or smokeless tobacco.

BACKGROUND: Assessing biomarker profiles in various body fluids is of large 
value to discern between the sole use of nicotine products. In particular, the 
assessment of the product compliance is required for long-term clinical studies. 
The objective of this study was the identification of biomarkers and biomarker 
patterns in body fluids, to distinguish between combustibles, heated tobacco 
products, electronic cigarettes, oral tobacco and oral/dermal nicotine products 
used for nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), as well as a control group of 
non-users.
METHODS: A controlled, single-center study was conducted with 60 healthy 
subjects, divided into 6 groups (5 nicotine product user groups and one non-user 
group) based on their sole use of the products of choice. The subjects were 
confined for 76 h, during which, free and uncontrolled use of the products was 
provided. Sample collections were performed according to the study time schedule 
provided in Table 2. The primary outcome will be validated through analysis of 
the collected biospecimens (urine, blood, saliva, exhaled breath and exhaled 
breath condensate) by means of untargeted omics approaches (i.e. exposomics, 
breathomics and adductomics). Secondary outcome will include established 
biomarker quantification methods to allow for the identification of typical 
biomarker patterns. Statistical analysis tools will be used to specifically 
discriminate different product use categories.
RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: The clinical trial was successfully completed in May 2020, 
resulting in sample management and preparations for the quantitative and 
qualitative analyses. This work will serve as a solid basis to discern between 
biomarker profiles of different nicotine product user groups. The knowledge 
collected during this research will be required to develop prototype diagnostic 
tools that can reliably assess the differences and evaluate possible health 
risks of various nicotine products.

[A new score system for prediction of death in patients with severe trauma: the 
value of death warning score].

[Article in Chinese]

Xueyuan L, Yu S, Min G, Ya X, He J, Miao C, Huaping L, Tao C.

OBJECTIVE: To discuss a best predictive score index in predicting death in 
patients with severe trauma, death warning score, and to provide a simple score 
for clinical use.
METHODS: The clinical data of 394 traumatic patients admitted to Department of 
Critical Care Medicine of Xi'nan Hospital of the Third Military Medical 
University, Daping Hospital of the Third Military Medical University, and 
Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical College from January 2014 to December 2014 
were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were divided into survival group (n 
= 330) and non-survival group (n = 64). The clinical data in two groups were 
recorded as following: gender, age; respiratory rate, heart rate, and systolic 
blood pressure at admission; the lowest values of serum creatinine (SCr), white 
blood cell count (WBC), platelet count (PLT), hematocrit (Hct), respectively, 
within 24 hours after admission; acute physiology and chronic health evaluation 
II (APACHE II) score, Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score, sequential organ failure 
assessment (SOFA), systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) score, injury 
severity score (ISS) within 24 hours of final diagnosis; the performance of 
emergency operation or intubation within 24 hours; incidence of sepsis, and 
clinical outcomes. Each observed indicator was analyzed by univariate analysis, 
and factors leading to death were further analyzed by logistic regression. Risk 
factors of severe trauma patients were sorted, from which the meaningful 
indicators were included to calculate the warning score of death. Receiver 
operating characteristic curve (ROC) was plotted to evaluate the predictive 
value of the warning score of death in severe trauma patients.
RESULTS: Compared with the survival group, the age in non-survival group was 
older (years old: 51.50 ± 18.31 vs. 45.54 ± 14.70, t = -2.456, P = 0.016); SCr 
was increased (µmol/L: 94.18 ± 65.51 vs. 72.42 ± 28.22, t = -2.611, P = 0.011); 
APACHE II score (24.30 ± 6.23 vs. 16.38 ± 6.19, t = -9.353, P < 0.001) and SOFA 
score were higher (7.84 ± 3.68 vs. 4.43 ± 2.75, t = -7.049, P < 0.001); and the 
incidence of emergency intubation [79.7% (51/64) vs. 42.7% (141/330), χ² = 
29.309, P < 0.001] and sepsis was also higher [48.4% (31/64) vs. 30.3% 
(100/330), χ² = 18.512, P < 0.001], but PLT count (X 10⁹/L: 112.75 ± 59.85 vs. 
144.12 ± 68.28, t = 3.428, P = 0.001) and GCS score (6.44 ± 4.20 vs. 11.02 ± 
3.93, t = 8.449, P < 0.001) were significantly lower. There was no significant 
difference in gender, respiratory rate, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, 
WBC, Hct, SIRS score, ISS, or emergency operation between two groups. The 
indicators with statistically significant difference from the univariate 
analysis were further analyzed by multivariate logistic regression, and the 
indices included in the regression model were age ≥ 65 years [95% confidence 
interval (95%CI) = 0.176-1.974, P = 0.019], APACHE II score ≥ 21 (95% CI = 
0.121-2.725, P = 0.032), GCS < 6 (95% CI = 0.201-3.221, P = 0.026), severe 
sepsis (95%CI = 0.421-2.735, P = 0.008) or septic shock (95%CI = 0.430-3.636, P 
= 0.013), with assigning scores of 1.0, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 2.0, respectively. 
Finally these five indicators were included into the warning score of death. It 
was shown by ROC curve analysis that the area under ROC curve (AUC) of warning 
score of death in predicting mortality in critically ill trauma patients was 
0.867, which was significantly higher than that of the APACHE II score (AUC = 
0.812, P = 0.022) and GCS score (AUC = 0.783, P = 0.001). When the cut-off value 
of warning score of death was 1.5, the sensitivity, specificity, positive 
predict value (+PV), negative predict value (-PV), positive likelihood ratio 
(+LR), negative likelihood ratio (-LR), and Youden index was 75.00%, 85.40%, 
50.0%, 94.6%, 5.16, 0.29, and 0.605, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Age ≥ 65 years, APACHE II score ≥ 21, GCS < 6, severe sepsis or 
septic shock were the risk factors of death in patients with severe trauma, and 
they can be considered as warning score of death in patients with severe trauma. 
With the score mortality can be better predicted than any other kind of score 
for patients with severe trauma.

INTRODUCTION: The tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs) are an important group 
of carcinogens found in tobacco and tobacco smoke. To describe and characterize 
the levels of TSNAs in the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) 
Study Wave 1 (2013-2014), we present four biomarkers of TSNA exposure: 
N'-nitrosonornicotine, N'-nitrosoanabasine, N'-nitrosoanatabine, and 
4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL) which is the primary 
urinary metabolite of 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone.
METHODS: We measured total TSNAs in 11 522 adults who provided urine using 
automated solid-phase extraction coupled to isotope dilution liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. After exclusions in this current 
analysis, we selected 11 004 NNAL results, 10 753 N'-nitrosonornicotine results, 
10 919 N'-nitrosoanatabine results, and 10 996 N'-nitrosoanabasine results for 
data analysis. Geometric means and correlations were calculated using SAS and 
SUDAAN.
RESULTS: TSNA concentrations were associated with choice of tobacco product and 
frequency of use. Among established, every day, exclusive tobacco product users, 
the geometric mean urinary NNAL concentration was highest for smokeless tobacco 
users (993.3; 95% confidence interval [CI: 839.2, 1147.3] ng/g creatinine), 
followed by all types of combustible tobacco product users (285.4; 95% CI: 
[267.9, 303.0] ng/g creatinine), poly tobacco users (278.6; 95% CI: [254.9, 
302.2] ng/g creatinine), and e-cigarette product users (6.3; 95% CI: [4.7, 7.9] 
ng/g creatinine). TSNA concentrations were higher in every day users than in 
intermittent users for all the tobacco product groups. Among single product 
users, exposure to TSNAs differed by sex, age, race/ethnicity, and education. 
Urinary TSNAs and nicotine metabolite biomarkers were also highly correlated.
CONCLUSIONS: We have provided PATH Study estimates of TSNA exposure among US 
adult users of a variety of tobacco products. These data can inform future 
tobacco product and human exposure evaluations and related regulatory 
activities.

Urbana-Champaign, IL.

BACKGROUND: E-cigarettes, nicotine transdermal patches, and nicotine chewing gum 
are occasionally used as cigarette replacements by patients, but it is unknown 
if their use is a safe alternative to smoking in the perioperative period.
METHODS: All patients undergoing major surgery at a single outpatient ambulatory 
surgery center for a 5-year period were tested for urine cotinine, a nicotine 
metabolite, the day of surgery. Patients were divided into 4 groups: never 
smoked (group A), quit smoking with negative urine test (group B), continued to 
smoke (group C), and quit smoking with positive urine test (group D). 
Statistical significance of complications among groups was tested using right 
tailed chi-square test and point biserial correlation coefficient calculations. 
To control for confounding factors, age and BMI of each group were compared 
using unequal sample size and variance t tests.
RESULTS: Four hundred seventy patients were included in the study. Patient count 
in each group was group A n = 380, group B n = 48, group C n = 32, and group D n 
= 10. Complication frequency was as follows D > C > A > B. Statistically 
significant differences were observed between D + C (cotinine positive) and A + 
B (cotinine negative) P = 0.0001 and between D (nicotine replacement) and B 
(nicotine abstinence) P = 0.00026. There was neither statistical difference 
between groups A and B, nor C and D.
CONCLUSIONS: Nicotine replacement carries similar risks as continued smoking and 
is not as safe as abstinence in the perioperative period in plastic surgery 
patients. Importantly, patients who stopped smoking for the surgery had 
equivalent risk for postoperative complications as patients who had never 
smoked.

IMPORTANCE: It is important to develop a surgical technique to reduce 
dissemination of tumor cells into the blood during surgery.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the outcomes of different sequences of vessel ligation 
during surgery on the dissemination of tumor cells and survival in patients with 
non-small cell lung cancer.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This multicenter, randomized clinical trial 
was conducted from December 2016 to March 2018 with patients with non-small cell 
lung cancer who received thoracoscopic lobectomy in West China Hospital, Daping 
Hospital, and Sichuan Cancer Hospital. To further compare survival outcomes of 
the 2 procedures, we reviewed the Western China Lung Cancer database (2005-2017) 
using the same inclusion criteria.
INTERVENTIONS: Vein-first procedure vs artery-first procedure.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Changes in folate receptor-positive circulating 
tumor cells (FR+CTCs) after surgery and 5-year overall, disease-free, and lung 
cancer-specific survival.
RESULTS: A total of 86 individuals were randomized; 22 patients (25.6%) were 
younger and 64 (74.4%) older than 60 years. Of these, 78 patients were analyzed. 
After surgery, an incremental change in FR+CTCs was observed in 26 of 40 
patients (65.0%) in the artery-first group and 12 of 38 (31.6%) in the 
vein-first group (P = .003) (median change, 0.73 [interquartile range (IQR), 
-0.86 to 1.58] FU per 3 mL vs -0.50 [IQR, -2.53 to 0.79] FU per 3 mL; P = .006). 
Multivariate analysis confirmed that the artery-first procedure was a risk 
factor for FR+CTC increase during surgery (hazard ratio [HR], 4.03 [95% CI, 
1.53-10.63]; P = .005). The propensity-matched analysis included 420 patients 
(210 with vein-first procedures and 210 with artery-first procedures). The 
vein-first group had significantly better outcomes than the artery-first group 
for 5-year overall survival (73.6% [95% CI, 64.4%-82.8%] vs 57.6% [95% CI, 
48.4%-66.8%]; P = .002), disease-free survival (63.6% [95% CI, 55.4%-73.8%] vs 
48.4% [95% CI, 40.0%-56.8%]; P = .001), and lung cancer-specific survival (76.4% 
[95% CI, 67.6%-85.2%] vs 59.9% [95% CI, 50.5%-69.3%]; P = .002). Multivariate 
analyses revealed that the artery-first procedure was a prognostic factor of 
poorer 5-year overall survival (HR, 1.65 [95% CI, 1.07-2.56]; P = .03), 
disease-free survival (HR, 1.43 [95% CI, 1.01-2.04]; P = .05) and lung 
cancer-specific survival (HR = 1.65 [95% CI, 1.04-2.61]; P = .03).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Ligating effluent veins first during surgery may 
reduce tumor cell dissemination and improve survival outcomes in patients with 
non-small cell lung cancer.

Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarette) have emerged as a popular electronic 
nicotine delivery system (ENDS) in the last decade. Despite the absence of 
combustion products and toxins such as carbon monoxide (CO) and tobacco-specific 
nitrosamines (TSNA), carbonyls including short-chain, toxic aldehydes have been 
detected in e-cigarette-derived aerosols up to levels found in tobacco smoke. 
Given the health concerns regarding exposures to toxic aldehydes, understanding 
both aldehyde generation in e-cigarette and e-cigarette exposure is critical. 
Thus, we measured aldehydes generated in aerosols derived from propylene glycol 
(PG):vegetable glycerin (VG) mixtures and from commercial e-liquids with 
flavorants using a state-of-the-art carbonyl trap and mass spectrometry. To 
track e-cigarette exposure in mice, we measured urinary metabolites of 4 
aldehydes using ULPC-MS/MS or GC-MS. Aldehyde levels, regardless of abundance 
(saturated: formaldehyde, acetaldehyde >> unsaturated: acrolein, 
crotonaldehyde), were dependent on the PG:VG ratio and the presence of 
flavorants. The metabolites of 3 aldehydes - formate, acetate and 
3-hydroxypropyl mercapturic acid (3-HPMA; acrolein metabolite) -- were increased 
in urine after e-cigarette aerosol and mainstream cigarette smoke (MCS) 
exposures, but the crotonaldehyde metabolite 
(3-hydroxy-1-methylpropylmercapturic acid, HPMMA) was increased only after MCS 
exposure. Interestingly, exposure to menthol-flavored e-cigarette aerosol 
increased the levels of urinary 3-HPMA and sum of nicotine exposure (nicotine, 
cotinine, trans-3'-hydroxycotinine) relative to exposure to a Classic 
Tobacco-flavored e-cigarette aerosol. Comparing these findings with aerosols of 
other ENDS and by measuring aldehyde-derived metabolites in human urine 
following exposure to e-cigarette aerosols will further our understanding of the 
relationship between ENDS use, aldehyde exposure and health risk.

BACKGROUND: Electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) vaping, containing nicotine 
and/or Δ8, Δ9 or Δ10 or Δo tetrahydrocannabinol (Δn-THC), is associated with an 
outbreak of e-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated lung injury (EVALI). 
Despite thousands being hospitalised with EVALI, much remains unknown about 
diagnosis, treatment and disease pathogenesis. Biomarkers of inflammation, 
oxidative stress and lipid mediators may help identify e-cigarette users with 
EVALI.
METHODS: We collected plasma and urine along with demographic and vaping-related 
data of EVALI subjects (age 18-35 years) and non-users matched for sex and age 
in a pilot study. Biomarkers were assessed by ELISA/EIA and Luminex-based 
assays.
RESULTS: Elevated levels of THC metabolite (11-nor-9-carboxy-Δ9-THC) were found 
in plasma from EVALI subjects compared to non-users. Levels of 
8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), an oxidative DNA damage biomarker, and 
8-isoprostane, an oxidative stress marker, were slightly increased in urine 
samples from EVALI subjects compared to non-users. Conversely, plasma levels of 
lipid mediators, including resolvin D1 (RvD1) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), were 
significantly lower in EVALI subjects compared to non-users. Both 
pro-inflammatory biomarkers, such as tumour necrosis factor-α, macrophage 
inflammatory protein-1β, RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T-cell 
expressed and secreted) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, as 
well as anti-inflammatory biomarkers, such as interleukin-9 and CC10/16, were 
decreased in plasma from EVALI subjects compared to non-users, supportive of a 
possible dysregulated inflammatory response in EVALI subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: Significant elevations in urine and plasma biomarkers of oxidative 
stress, as well as reductions in lipid mediators, were shown in EVALI subjects. 
These noninvasive biomarkers (8-OHdG, 8-isoprostane, RvD1 and CC10/16), either 
individually or collectively, may serve as tools in diagnosing future EVALI 
subjects.

INTRODUCTION: The goal of this study was to evaluate the differences in urine 
cotinine (UC) concentration based on the use of conventional cigarettes, 
e-cigarettes (ECs), and dual product use, and determine the use of ECs in the 
real world.
METHODS: In total, 15099 subjects were classified into non-smokers, cigarette 
smokers (c-smokers), e-cigarette smokers (e-smokers), and dual users, and their 
UC (a classical biomarker of smoking) values were compared. Analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA) was performed after adjusting for age, sex and job status to 
analyze the differences in UC concentration in relation to type of smoking. The 
reasons for using ECs and the experience of cigarette use before using ECs were 
analyzed.
RESULTS: Of the 15099 people, 76.4% were non-smokers, 20.9% c-smokers, 2.3% dual 
users, and 0.4% were e-smokers. There were significant differences in UC 
concentration among the groups (p<0.001). The geometric mean (GM) UC 
concentration was 4.45 ng/mL. UC concentration was the highest among dual users 
(GM: 1030.5, median: 1258.9 ng/mL), followed by c-smokers (GM: 842.5, median: 
1163.0 ng/mL), e-smokers (GM: 119.5, median: 309.7 ng/mL), and non-smokers (GM: 
0.8, median: 0.8 ng/mL). Among the EC users, the rate of using ECs for health or 
social convenience was 81.9%. Among e-smokers, 11.4% had never smoked 
previously.
CONCLUSIONS: The UC concentration was the highest among dual users. However, for 
the female population, the UC concentration was the highest among e-smokers. The 
vast majority of EC users were dual users. In addition, there were no 
differences in the frequency of cigarette smoking between the dual user and 
c-smoker groups. Consequently, EC use did not lead to a decrease in cigarette 
use, but did lead to an increase in UC concentration. Therefore, in the real 
world, dual users have higher cotinine levels than the other groups, which could 
indicate that they take more nicotine by cigarettes or ECs, or are more addicted 
than others.

AIMS: To compare the use of alternative nicotine products, smoking behavior and 
tobacco biomarker exposure in smokers unwilling to quit who were assigned 
randomly to normal nicotine content (NNC) cigarettes or very low nicotine 
content (VLNC) cigarettes.
DESIGN: Randomized, parallel-arm 8-week study with assignment to VLNC (VLNC 1, 
n = 53) or NNC (NNC, n = 27) with access to non-cigarette combusted and 
non-combusted tobacco/nicotine products or to VLNC with access to only 
non-combusted products (VLNC2, n = 56).
SETTING: Clinics in Minnesota, USA.
PARTICIPANTS: Smokers uninterested in quitting smoking with a mean [± standard 
deviation (SD)] age of 44 (± 14) years and smoking 16 (± seven) cigarettes/day; 
51% female, 72% white.
MEASUREMENTS: During the experimental period, the measures taken included: rate 
of alternative products used, amount of and abstinence from combusted tobacco 
used and tobacco exposure biomarkers.
FINDINGS: There were higher rates of non-combusted alternative tobacco/nicotine 
product use in both VLNC conditions versus the NNC condition [rate ratio 
(RR) = 2.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.94, 2.46 and RR = 1.64, 95% 
CI = 1.46, 1.85, respectively] and in VLNC1 versus VLNC2 condition (RR = 1.33, 
95% CI = 1.23, 1.44), accompanied by reduced biomarkers of exposure primarily in 
VLNC2 condition compared to NNC condition (Ps < 0.05). Fewer combusted products 
were smoked at almost all visits (Ps ≤ 0.02) and there were higher rates of 
abstinence for both VLNC conditions compared with the NNC condition (VLNC1 
versus NNC: RR = 9.96, 95% CI = 5.01, 19.81; VLNC2 versus NNC: RR = 11.23, 95% 
CI = 5.74, 21.97).
CONCLUSION: The offer of, and instructions to use, reduced nicotine content 
cigarettes during an 8-week period led to greater use of alternative 
tobacco/nicotine products compared with continued use of normal nicotine 
cigarettes and also reductions in smoking rates.

Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation in Nicotine Use: Nursing Implications 
for Patient Outcomes.

Gwon SH, Lee HJ, Brian Ahn H.

Tobacco use is a leading cause of cancer, cardiovascular and respiratory 
disease, and preventable death in the United States. The brains of individuals 
with nicotine dependence are characterized by damaged mesolimbic pathways in the 
medial portion of the limbic and frontal lobes, creating positive reinforcing 
mechanisms. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) targets this 
neuroadaptation to improve smokers' nicotine-related outcomes, such as craving 
and smoking behavior, by depolarizing or hyperpolarizing the neurons of the 
brain. Recent literature reported promising outcomes in smokers after tDCS 
treatment interventions. tDCS has great potential for clinical nursing research 
for tobacco control given its multiple methodological advantages and few 
disadvantages. Nurse researchers can consider individualized and home-based tDCS 
interventions for community-based tobacco control research and may need to 
consider objective outcome measures (e.g., cotinine in urine) and 
addiction-related cognitive variables (e.g., self-regulation). Users of 
electronic nicotine delivery systems also need to be considered as participants 
in tDCS interventions. Additional considerations for nursing research are 
discussed.

INTRODUCTION: Approximately the same percentage of male high school students in 
the United States currently uses conventional smokeless tobacco as smokes 
cigarettes, resulting in toxin exposure.
METHODS: This study assessed tobacco product use (smokeless, combustible, and 
electronic cigarettes) and nicotine and carcinogen exposures in a sample of 594 
male rural high school baseball players-a population traditionally at risk for 
smokeless tobacco use. Salivary specimens were assayed for cotinine (a biomarker 
of nicotine exposure) and urine specimens for 
4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL, a biomarker of the 
carcinogen 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) using liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: The prevalence of past 30-day use of any tobacco product was 29%. Past 
7-day smokeless tobacco use (prevalence: 13%) was associated with the highest 
levels of cotinine and NNAL observed in the sample, whether smokeless tobacco 
was used exclusively (geometric means: cotinine 11.1 ng/mL; NNAL 31.9 
pg/mg-creatinine) or in combination with combustible products (geometric means: 
cotinine 31.6 ng/mL; NNAL 50.0 pg/mg creatinine). Cotinine and NNAL levels were 
incrementally higher in each increasing category of smokeless tobacco use 
frequency. However, observed levels were lower than previously reported for 
adults, likely reflecting less smokeless use per day among adolescents.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on these biomarker observations, adolescents who use 
conventional smokeless tobacco products are exposed to substantial levels of 
nicotine and NNK. Although exposed to lower levels than adult smokeless users, 
the findings are concerning given the young age of the sample and tendency for 
smokeless tobacco users to increase use intensity over time.
IMPLICATIONS: This study demonstrates that adolescents using smokeless tobacco 
are exposed to levels of nicotine and NNK that increase with use frequency and 
that exceed exposures among peers using other tobacco products. Youth smokeless 
tobacco use in the United States has not declined along with youth smoking 
prevalence, giving greater importance to this health concern. To reduce youth 
(and adult) exposures, needed actions include effective smokeless tobacco use 
prevention, potentially in combination with reducing the levels of harmful and 
potentially harmful chemicals in smokeless tobacco products currently popular 
among adolescents.

Electronic cigarettes are novel tobacco products that are frequently used these 
days. The cartridge contains liquid nicotine and accidental poisoning, even with 
a small oral dose, endangers children. We present here a mortality case of a 
15-month-old child who ingested liquid nicotine mistaking it for cold medicine. 
When the emergency medical technicians arrived, she was found to have pulseless 
electrical activity. Spontaneous circulation was restored after approximately 40 
minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The cotinine level in her urine was 
1,716 ng/mL. Despite intensive supportive care, severe anoxic brain injury was 
found on computed tomography and the child ultimately died. This fatality 
highlights the need for public health efforts to minimize such accidents.

BACKGROUND: Youth vaping poses a significant public health concern as metals 
have been detected in e-cigarette aerosols and liquids. This study investigated 
factors associated with biomarkers of metal exposure.
METHODS: Data were drawn from Wave 5 of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and 
Health (PATH) Study Youth Panel, a nationally representative sample of US 
adolescents aged 13-17 years. Urinary biomarkers of exposure to cadmium, lead, 
and uranium were assessed by vaping frequency (occasional (1-5 days), 
intermittent (6-19 days), and frequent (20+ days)) in the past 30 days and 
flavour type (menthol/mint, fruit, and sweet).
RESULTS: Among 200 exclusive e-cigarette users (median age 15.9 years, 62.9% 
female), 65 reported occasional use, 45 reported intermittent use, and 81 
reported frequent use. The average number of recent puffs per day increased 
exponentially by vaping frequency (occasional: 0.9 puffs, intermittent: 7.9 
puffs, frequent: 27.0 puffs; p=0.001). Both intermittent (0.21 ng/mg creatinine) 
and frequent users (0.20 ng/mg creatinine) had higher urine lead levels than 
occasional users (0.16 ng/mg creatinine). Frequent users also had higher urine 
uranium levels compared with occasional users (0.009 vs 0.005 ng/mg creatinine, 
p=0.0004). Overall, 33.0% of users preferred using menthol/mint flavours, 49.8% 
fruit flavours, and 15.3% sweet flavours. Sweet flavour users had higher uranium 
levels compared with menthol/mint users (0.009 vs 0.005 ng/mg creatinine, 
p=0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: Vaping in early life could increase the risk of exposure to metals, 
potentially harming brain and organ development. Regulations on vaping should 
safeguard the youth population against addiction and exposure to metals.

Palestinian adolescent refugees are at increased risk for behaviors that can 
lead to poor health outcomes, such as high-risk substance use. This research 
focuses on the prevalence of substance use and its relationship with depression 
among adolescent male refugees in Palestine's North-West Bank. A cross-sectional 
study was conducted in five of seven refugee camps to gather data using a 
proportional stratified sampling technique. A structured questionnaire-based 
interview was conducted to gather sociodemographic data, self-reported substance 
use, and depression scale information. Additionally, urine screening tests were 
used to detect the presence of different drugs in participants' urine samples. 
The final sample size was 386 refugee males; 24.0% were workers, and 13.7% 
worked previously. For self-reported substance use, 26.9%;12.4%; 28.0%; 37.0%; 
and 60.4%, 2.6% of adolescents reported current users of cigarettes, 
e-cigarettes, waterpipe, coffee, energy drinks (ED), and alcohol, respectively. 
Moreover, 3.4% tested positive for at least one drug. The drugs that tested 
positive were as follows: PCP (5%), MDMA (1.8%), THC (1.6%), BZO (0.5%), and MET 
(0.5%). The adjusted logistic regression showed an increased risk of depression 
among workers (OR = 3.777; p-value = 0.008), cigarette smokers (OR = 2.948; 
p-value = 0.04), waterpipe smokers (OR = 4.458; p-value = 0.041), and coffee 
users (OR = 2.883, p-value = 0.046). In conclusion, Palestinian adolescent 
refugees are at increased risk for behaviors that can lead to poor health 
outcomes, such as high-risk substance use, including illicit drugs, alcohol use, 
tobacco smoking, and ED intake. The results of this study reveal alarming 
figures on drug use associated with depression in refugee camps which demand 
controlling interventions.

Various stimulants (VS) are chemicals that disrupt the endocrine system - 
endocrine homeostasis of the reproductive system - which also known as 
endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs). These substances are found in the human 
body, in both the blood and urine, amniotic fluid, or, among others, the adipose 
tissue. This article presents the current state of knowledge of the effect of 
EDCs and additional factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, and cannabis 
on the gonads. The article is an overview of the impact of EDCs and their 
mechanism of action, with particular emphasis on gonads, based on databases such 
as PubMed, EMBASE and Google Scholar, and Web of Science available until May 
2022. The impact of human exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) is not fully understood, 
but it has been shown that phthalates show a negative correlation in 
anti-androgenic activity in the case of men and women for the anti-Müllerian 
hormone (AMH). Smoking cigarettes and passive exposure to tobacco have a huge 
impact on the effects of endocrine disorders in both women and men, especially 
during the reproductive time. Also, the use of large amounts of cannabinoids 
during the reproductive years can lead to similar disorders. It has been 
documented that excessive alcohol consumption leads to disturbed function of the 
hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPG). Excess caffeine consumption may 
adversely affect male reproductive function, although this is not fully proven. 
Therefore, the following publication presents various stimulants (BPA, 
phthalates, nicotine, alcohol, cannabis) that disrupt the function of the 
endocrine system and, in particular, affect the function of the gonads.

Aromatic amines such as ortho-toluidine (o-Tol), 2-aminonaphthalene (2-AN), and 
4-aminobiphenyl (4-ABP) are human bladder carcinogens and occur at various 
workplaces, in ambient air, in food products, as well as in tobacco smoke. In a 
clinical study comprising a period of 74 h under confinement, we investigated 
the exposure to these three aromatic amines as well as to 3-aminobiphenyl 
(3-ABP) by measuring them in urine of habitual users of combustible cigarettes 
(CCs), electronic cigarettes (ECs), heated tobacco products (HTPs), oral tobacco 
(OT), and nicotine replacement therapy products (NRTs). Non-users (NU) of any 
tobacco/nicotine products served as (negative) control group. Smokers (CC) 
exhibited the highest levels for all four aromatic amines measured, 
significantly elevated compared to NU and non-CC users. Urinary levels in users 
of EC, HTP, NRT (mostly nicotine gum), and OT (mostly snus) were not 
significantly different from those in NU. Users of HTP showed slightly elevated 
urinary excretion levels of o-Tol, 3-ABP, and 4-ABP compared to some other 
non-CC groups. Dose markers such as daily consumption, urinary nicotine 
equivalents (Nequ), and plasma cotinine (CotP) were found to be consistently and 
significantly correlated with the excretion of aromatic amines for smokers (CC) 
only. Excretion levels of 3- and 4-ABP in smokers were significantly lower in 
the urine collected overnight compared to that collected during the day, which 
is just the opposite of what we observed for other biomarkers in this study. The 
possible reason for this observation is discussed. In conclusion, in contrast to 
smoking of CCs, the use of ECs, HTPs, nicotine gum, and oral tobacco was not 
observed to be associated with significant exposure to the aromatic amines 
o-Tol, 2-AN, 3-ABP, and 4-ABP. The observed slight increase in o-Tol, 3-ABP, and 
4-ABP excretions in HTP users has to be verified in larger studies.

BACKGROUND: Many people use both combustible cigarette (CC) and electronic 
cigarette (EC). We compared nicotine dependence among CC, EC, and dual users 
using questionnaires and urinary cotinine levels.
METHODS: Data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
(2014-2017) databases were analyzed; 3,917 CC, EC, and dual users were 
administered the urinary cotinine test, and 1,045 current CC and dual users 
completed the Heaviness of Smoking Index (HSI) questionnaires. Weighted 
geometric means of urine cotinine levels were compared between exclusive CC, 
exclusive EC, and dual users. The distribution rate, based on time to first 
cigarette (TTFC), cigarettes per day (CPD), and the HSI was analyzed in two 
weighted groups, exclusive CC and dual users.
RESULTS: Among those who currently use any type of cigarette, 89.4%, 1.4%, and 
9.2% were exclusive CC, exclusive EC, and dual users, respectively. Weighted 
geometric means of urine cotinine were highest in dual users (1,356.4 ng/mL), 
followed by exclusive CC (1,270.3 ng/mL), and exclusive EC (867.7 ng/mL) with 
significant differences between all three groups (P<0.05). There were no 
statistically significant differences in CPD between exclusive CC and dual users 
(P=0.626). The proportion of TTFC ≤5 minutes was 21.5% and 29.5% in the two 
groups, respectively (P=0.010); however, HSI differences in the two groups was 
marginal (P=0.557).
CONCLUSION: In this study, the urinary cotinine value could distinguish the 
three groups, CC, EC, and dual users, but the questionnaire using HSI could not 
distinguish the three groups.

products.

Today various tobacco and nicotine products are available, many of them can be 
regarded as potentially risk-reduced products when compared to the most 
frequently used product, combustible cigarettes (CCs). A commonality of these 
products is that they deliver nicotine, although in quite different amounts and 
uptake routes, the most common of which are inhalation through the lung and 
absorption through the oral mucosa. Product-specific nicotine delivery as well 
as the subject-related use patterns are important factors which determine the 
pharmacokinetics and achieved internal dose levels of the alkaloid. The latter 
two parameters are highly relevant for the long-term product loyalty and, 
consequently, for the implicated health risks, since the risk-reduced products 
will replace CCs in the long-term only when users will experience a similar 
level of satisfaction. We measured nicotine and its major metabolites in plasma, 
saliva and urine samples collected in a controlled clinical study with habitual 
users (10 per group) of CCs, electronic cigarettes (ECs), heated tobacco 
products (HTP), oral tobacco (OT), and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). 
Non-users (NU) of any tobacco/nicotine products served as (negative) control 
group. Moderate to strong correlations were observed between the daily 
consumption and the urinary nicotine equivalents (comprising nicotine and its 10 
major metabolites, Nic + 10) or plasma and saliva cotinine concentrations. The 
average daily nicotine dose as measured by the urinary excretion of Nic + 10 
(reflecting approximately 95 % of the absorbed nicotine) amounted to 17 and 
22 mg/24 h for smokers (CC) and OT users, respectively, while it was in the 
range of 6-12 mg/24 h for users of ECs, HTP and NRT products, with high 
inter-individual variations in each user group. The individual daily nicotine 
intake, which was calculated by applying product-specific models, showed none to 
good agreement with the corresponding internal nicotine dose measured by 
Nic + 10 excretion. Possible reasons for the observed deviations between 
calculated and objectively measured nicotine doses are discussed.

Vaping is the process of inhaling an aerosol produced by heating a liquid or wax 
containing substances such as nicotine, cannabinoids (e.g., 
tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol), flavoring, and additives (e.g., glycerol, 
propylene glycol). The presence of air or gas in the mediastinum is 
pneumomediastinum. We present a rare case of vaping-induced spontaneous 
pneumomediastinum. A young 20-year-old female patient with a history of vaping 
and no past medical history presented with acute chest pain to an emergency 
room. The urine drug screen was positive for cannabinoids. Imaging studies - 
chest x-ray and computed tomography of the chest - showed pneumomediastinum. The 
patient was discharged after a day of observation and counseling to quit vaping.

INTRODUCTION: Acute exposure to e-cigarette aerosol has been shown to have 
potentially deleterious effects on the cardiovascular system. However, the 
cardiovascular effects of habitual e-cigarette use have not been fully 
elucidated. Therefore, we aimed to assess the association of habitual 
e-cigarette use with endothelial dysfunction and inflammation - subclinical 
markers known to be associated with increased cardiovascular risk.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we analyzed data from 46 participants 
(23 exclusive e-cigarette users; 23 non-users) enrolled in the 
VAPORS-Endothelial function study. E-cigarette users had used e-cigarettes for 
≥6 consecutive months. Non-users had used e-cigarettes <5 times and had a 
negative urine cotinine test (<30 ng/mL). Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and 
reactive hyperemia index (RHI) were used to assess endothelial dysfunction, and 
we assayed high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, fibrinogen, 
p-selectin, and myeloperoxidase as serum measures of inflammation. We used 
multivariable linear regression to assess the association of e-cigarette use 
with the markers of endothelial dysfunction and inflammation.
RESULTS: Of the 46 participants with mean age of 24.3 ± 4.0 years, the majority 
were males (78%), non-Hispanic (89%), and White (59%). Among non-users, 6 had 
cotinine levels <10 ng/mL while 17 had levels 10-30 ng/mL. Conversely, among 
e-cigarette users, the majority (14 of 23) had cotinine ≥500 ng/mL. At baseline, 
the systolic blood pressure was higher among e-cigarette users than non-users 
(p=0.011). The mean FMD was slightly lower among e-cigarette users (6.32%) 
compared to non-users (6.53%). However, in the adjusted analysis, current 
e-cigarette users did not differ significantly from non-users in their mean FMD 
(Coefficient=2.05; 95% CI: -2.52-6.63) or RHI (Coefficient= -0.20; 95% CI: 
-0.88-0.49). Similarly, the levels of inflammatory markers were generally low 
and did not differ between e-cigarette users and non-users.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that e-cigarette use may not be significantly 
associated with endothelial dysfunction and systemic inflammation in relatively 
young and healthy individuals. Longer term studies with larger sample sizes are 
needed to validate these findings.

Toxicity From Blue Lotus (Nymphaea caerulea) After Ingestion or Inhalation: A 
Case Series.

Plant extracts and other novel psychoactives can be ingested, vaped, injected, 
or insufflated. This includes products such as extracts from the blue lotus 
flower (Nypmhaea caerulea), which is known to produce euphoria and 
hallucinations at high doses. Blue lotus is sold in several forms, including 
dried plant material, teas, and extracts for use in electronic cigarettes. 
Because newer generations of electronic cigarettes can deliver a variety of 
substances, practitioners need to be mindful of toxicity from a growing number 
of psychoactives, some of which are not detectable by standard urine drug 
screens. This case series describes five active duty patients who presented to 
the emergency department with altered mental status following the use of blue 
lotus products, four after vaping and one after making an infused beverage. 
Patients displayed similar symptoms, including sedation and perceptual 
disturbances. The patients in our series were successfully managed with 
supportive measures without the need for sedating agents. Recognizing and 
identifying new trends in substance use can help to provide directions in

INTRODUCTION: Alternative tobacco products, including electronic cigarettes 
(e-cigarettes) and non-combustible tobacco products or heat-not-burn (HNB) 
products, are substitutes to conventional combustible cigarettes with the 
potential to impact urologic health, similar to traditional smoking. Most 
urologists, however, have limited knowledge of these products and are unfamiliar 
with their potential health implications. We conducted a review to assess the 
impact of e-cigarettes and HNB products on urologic health.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A bibliographic search covering the period up to April, 
2021 was conducted using MEDLINE®/PubMed® and Google Scholar. Articles were 
reviewed and categorized based on the potential impact on erectile dysfunction, 
semen quality, lower urinary tract symptoms, genitourinary malignancies, and 
smoking cessation. Data were extracted, analyzed and summarized.
RESULTS: Mature data on the long-term impact of e-cigarette and HNB product use 
on urologic health are lacking. E-cigarette and HNB vapors appear to contain 
decreased concentrations of chemicals responsible for erectile dysfunction 
compared to tobacco smoke but may play a role through endothelial damage. Use of 
e-cigarettes is associated with lower sperm counts. No definitive data has shown 
a link between e-cigarette or HNB product use and lower urinary tract symptoms. 
Multiple carcinogens including those specifically linked to bladder cancer have 
been identified in the urine of e-cigarette and HNB product users. Limited data 
suggest e-cigarettes may aid in smoking cessation.
CONCLUSIONS: Urologists may benefit from understanding the urologic health 
concerns surrounding e-cigarettes and HNB product use and patients may benefit 
from being properly educated.

BACKGROUND: Cigarette smoking is associated with a number of diseases, such as 
cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Recently, there has been an increase in the 
use of electronic cigarettes (ECs) and tobacco-heating products (THPs) as an 
alternative to cigarettes, which may reduce the health burden associated with 
smoking. However, an exposure continuum when smokers switch to ECs or THPs 
compared to complete smoking cessation is not well established.
METHODS: 148 healthy smokers were randomized to either continue smoking 
cigarettes, switch to using the glo THP or a prototype EC, or completely quit 
any nicotine or tobacco product use for 5 days, after a 2-day baseline period. 
During this study breath and 24-h urine samples were collected for Biomarker of 
Exposure (BoE) analysis.
RESULTS: After a 5-day switching period BoE levels showed a substantial 
significant decrease in levels from baseline in the groups using the glo THP, 
the prototype EC, and having quit all nicotine and tobacco use. On an exposure 
continuum, smokers who completely quit nicotine had the lowest levels of 
assessed BoEs, followed by those who switched to the EC and then those who 
switched to glo THP use. Participants who continued to smoke had the highest 
levels of BoEs.
CONCLUSIONS: THP or EC use over a 5-day period resulted in significant 
reductions in exposure to smoke toxicants, in some cases to levels similar to 
those for nicotine cessation. These results show that on an exposure continuum, 
nicotine cessation gives the greatest reduction in exposure to tobacco smoke 
toxicants, closely followed by the EC and the glo THP. These significant 
reductions in exposure to toxicants suggest that the glo THP and EC have the 
potential to be Reduced Risk Products.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this descriptive study was to determine the 
sociodemographic characteristics of electronic (e)-cigarette users for 
clarifying the causes of e-cigarette smoking and to identify the carbon monoxide 
(CO) and urinary cotinine levels of the volunteers.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty volunteers who smoked e-cigarettes completed a 
questionnaire, and their exhaled CO and urinary cotinine levels were measured. 
An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit was used for cotinine analysis.
RESULTS: Overall, 85% of the participants were males, 60% were married, and 75% 
were college/university graduates. The median age of participants was 38.5 
years. The participants' main reasons for starting to smoke were peer influence 
and curiosity. The participants' main reasons for smoking e-cigarettes were to 
quit and reduce smoking the conventional cigarettes and cost effectiveness. Only 
three people knew that smoking was harmful to health. The participants' CO 
levels were measured as a median of 3, lowest of 1, and highest of 22. Cotinine 
levels were "positive" in all samples. A moderate and statistically significant 
correlation was found between the amount of fluids used by the participants in 1 
day (mL) and cotinine levels in urine specimens (Pearson correlation test, 
r=0.511, p=0.025).
CONCLUSION: The study is an important proof of the country's scientific work on 
e-cigarettes. Preventive strategies should be very strictly implemented for any 
tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, as they harm individuals and the 
community.

INTRODUCTION: The rapid growth in the e-cigarette market after the launch of 
JUUL e-cigarettes led to much discussion on the potential benefits and risks of 
pods, JUUL devices, and conventional e-cigarettes compared with combustible 
cigarettes. Independent data are required to assess the effects of these 
products on cardiovascular surrogate parameters and cardiovascular risk.
METHODS: We conducted a single-center three-arm study comparing combustible 
cigarettes with JUUL e-cigarettes with the old and new technology. We recruited 
32 participants who were active smokers (n=15) or vapers (n=17) and performed a 
total of 39 measurements before and 5, 15, and 30 minutes, after participants 
smoked a combustible cigarette or vaped a JUUL e-cigarette with the new or old 
technology. Measurements included peripheral and central blood pressures and 
parameters of arterial stiffness, including pulse wave velocity and augmentation 
index.
RESULTS: Peripheral systolic blood pressure, central blood pressure, and 
peripheral pulse rate increased significantly in all three groups (each p<0.05). 
Heart rate (HR) changes lasted significantly longer than blood pressure changes. 
The augmentation index and pulse wave velocity increased in all three groups, 
and a multivariate analysis of variance showed that the increases were 
independent of systolic blood pressure, sex, age, device, and HR.
CONCLUSIONS: Changes in blood pressure and arterial stiffness are similar after 
cigarette smoking and JUUL use. These changes may be associated with an 
increased cardiovascular risk compared with no product use. However, a long-term 
follow-up evaluation of JUUL use and a head-to-head comparison with conventional 
e-cigarettes are still needed.

BACKGROUND: Smoking is a significant health hazard and contributes to 
cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases. It can increase postoperative 
complications during oral and maxillofacial surgery due to its topical effect on 
the oral mucosa. New alternatives to traditional tobacco products are gaining 
popularity, in particular, electronic cigarettes.
OBJECTIVES: This pilot study investigated the acute effects of 
nicotine-containing and nicotine-free electronic cigarettes on palatal blood 
flow (PBF), and compared their effects to traditional cigarettes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 14 medically healthy volunteers (8 males, 6 females, age: 
34.7 ± 7.0) were recruited for the study. All patients (N = 14) were requested 
to smoke nicotine-containing (ECN) and nicotine-free electronic cigarettes (EC0) 
and a mouthpiece (end of a traditional cigarette) as a control sham smoking 
blind test (BT). EC users did not smoke a traditional cigarette (TC), resulting 
in 10 people in the TC group. Palatal blood flow was measured by Laser Speckle 
Contrast Imager before, immediately after, and 15 min after the exposures. 
Exhaled carbon monoxide (eCO) and carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) were measured before 
and immediately after smoking with a piCO+ Smokerlyzer machine.
RESULTS: In all groups, no significant differences were observed in the changes 
of palatal blood flow between time points. Exhaled carbon monoxide and 
carboxyhemoglobin were significantly higher in the traditional cigarette (TC) 
group compared to the nicotine-containing electronic cigarette (ECN) and 
nicotine-free electronic cigarette (EC0) groups, both before and after the 
exposure (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Acute use of either traditional or electronic cigarettes may have 
minimal impact on palatal blood flow, but additional studies are required to 
clarify their impact on the mucosa.

Maternal smoking with obligatory nicotine inhalation is associated with preterm 
delivery, low birth weight, fetal growth retardation and developmental defects. 
We tested the hypothesis that cigarette smoking-relevant nicotine inhalation 
during pregnancy impairs cardiovascular function and uterine hemodynamics with 
consequential fetal ischemia. Pregnant rats exposed to episodic inhaled nicotine 
via a novel lung alveolar region-targeted aerosol method produced nicotine 
pharmacokinetics resembling cigarette smoking in humans. This clinically 
relevant nicotine aerosol inhalation (NAI) induced transient reduction and 
irregular fluctuations in uterine artery blood flow associated with cardiac 
arrhythmia and high magnitude irregular fluctuations of systemic blood pressure. 
The arrhythmia included sinoatrial (SA) block, sinus arrest, 2° and 3° 
atrioventricular (A-V) block and supraventricular escape rhythm. These effects 
were blocked by the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) antagonist 
mecamylamine. Resection of the ovarian nerve, which innervates uterine blood 
vessels, counteracted the NAI-induced reduction in uterine blood flow. We 
suggest that the rapid rise pattern of arterial blood nicotine concentration 
stimulates and then desensitizes autonomic nAChRs leading to disruptions of 
cardiac function as well as systemic and uterine hemodynamics that reduces 
uteroplacental blood flow, a mechanism underlying maternal smoking-associated 
pregnancy complications and developmental disorders. These findings challenge 
the safety of pure nicotine inhalation, i.e., E-cigarettes.

OBJECTIVES: We measured biomarkers of exposure among American Indian (AI) ENDS 
users, smokers, and dual users.
METHODS: Urine was analyzed for total nicotine equivalents (TNE) and 
4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol(NNAL). Expired-air carbon monoxide 
(CO) was collected. Two analyses were performed. "CO analysis" included smokers 
and dual users whose CO was ≥ 6 ppm and ENDS users whose CO was < 6 ppm. "NNAL 
analysis" included smokers and dual users whose NNAL was ≥ 47.3 pg/mg, and ENDS 
users whose NNAL was < 47.3 pg/mg. Biomarkers were summarized by geometric means 
(GM) and compared with nonparametric tests.
RESULTS: In both analyses, TNE was no different across the groups, and NNAL and 
CO were lower in ENDS users. In the NNAL analysis the GM of NNAL was 261.4, 6.1, 
and 228.0 pg/mg among smokers, ENDS users, and dual users (p < .001). Also in 
the NNAL analysis, the GM of CO was 14.7, 2.4, and 16.8 ppm among smokers, ENDS 
users, and dual users (p < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: ENDS users did not differ in nicotine and had lower exposure to a 
lung carcinogen and a cardiovascular toxicant than smokers or dual users. Dual 
users and smokers did not differ in biomarker levels. Results should be used to 
inform tribal regulations and to educate the AI community on ENDS.

The use of electronic cigarettes among the young adult and adolescent population 
has increased over the past decade. Vaping is the process of inhaling an aerosol 
that is produced by heating a liquid or wax containing substances, such as 
nicotine, cannabinoids (e.g., tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol), 
flavoring, and additives (e.g., glycerol, propylene glycol) using an 
e-cigarette. A multistate epidemic associated with vaping prompted the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to issue an official health advisory on 
e-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury (EVALI). EVALI is a 
diagnosis of exclusion with no specific diagnostic test. We present a case of 
EVALI before the COVID-19 pandemic time in a 23-year-old immunocompetent male 
student with an eight-year history of vaping. He presented to the emergency 
department with fever, shortness of breath, tachypnea, nausea, and diarrhea. The 
patient had no past medical history. The patient denied illicit drug abuse or 
known drug allergies. The patient was admitted with a diagnosis of sepsis and 
pneumonia. The patient's urine drug screen was positive for cannabinoids with a 
history of vaping. Community-acquired pneumonia due to Legionella, Pneumococcal, 
Mycoplasma bacteria was ruled out. Influenza A/B, Parainfluenza, Rhino, and 
Adenoviruses were negative. A computed tomographyscan of the chest showed 
bilateral infiltrates. He was treated with high dose steroids, empiric 
antibiotics, high flow oxygen and managed in ICU for seven days. The patient was 
discharged on tapering doses of steroid and counseled to quit vaping. EVALI 
outbreak is strongly linked to vitamin E acetate in vaping products. EVALI is a 
diagnosis of exclusion with a history of vaping and responds well to steroids.

BACKGROUND: Despite the introduction of tobacco control measures, smoking 
remains highly prevalent in most EU countries. In Italy, one in four adults were 
still regular smokers in 2017. Increasing use of combustion-free delivering 
nicotine technologies for cigarette substitution may accelerate the current 
downward trends in smoking prevalence. Whether Heated Tobacco Products (HTPs) 
are more effective tobacco smoking substitutes that may potentially facilitate 
adoption and full conversion compared to e-cigarettes (ECs) is not known.We have 
designed a prospective study to compare changes in cigarette consumption and 
adoption rates among smokers randomized to either HTPs or ECs. Product 
acceptability, tolerability, and their tobacco harm reduction potential will be 
also compared.
METHODS: 220 healthy smokers, not motivated to quit, will be randomized into a 
12-weeks single-center, open label, non-inferiority trial comparing study 
outcomes from HTPs vs. ECs use. The primary outcome will be biochemically 
verified self-reported continuous abstinence at 12-weeks from the previous 
visit. Secondary outcomes will include: smoking reduction from baseline, 
adoption rates and product acceptability, tolerability, changes in step test 
values and in the level of selected biomarkers of exposure in exhaled breath 
(i.e. eCO) and in spot urine samples. A follow-up visit will be also included at 
24-weeks to review product usage and smoking behavior under naturalistic 
condition of use.Recruitment of participants started in May 2019 and enrolment 
is expected to be completed in November 2019.
DISCUSSION: This will be the first study directly comparing Heated Tobacco 
Products with Electronic Cigarettes in term of reduction in cigarette 
consumption, adoption rates, product acceptability, tolerability, and tobacco 
harm reduction potential. This knowledge can contribute to a better 
understanding of the potential role of this new technology in the evolving 
nicotine consumer market.

BACKGROUND: The study aims to explore the association between cigarette smoking 
with blood exposure to volatile organic compounds using population data from the 
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2017-2018.
METHODS: Based on the data of NHANES 2017-2018, we identified 1117 participants 
aged 18 to 65 years, who had complete VOCs testing data and filled out the 
Smoking-Cigarette Use and Volatile Toxicant questionnaires. The participants 
consisted of 214 dual-smoking persons, 41 E-cigarette smokers, 293 
combustible-cigarette smokers and 569 non-smokers. We used One-way ANOVA and 
Welch's ANOVA to compare differences of VOCs concentration among 4 groups and 
multivariable regression model to confirm the factors associated with VOCs 
concentration.
RESULTS: In dual-smoking and combustible-cigarette smokers, blood concentration 
of 2,5-Dimethylfuran, Benzene, Benzonitrile, Furan, Isobutyronitrile were higher 
than non-smokers. When compared with people who never smoked, E-cigarette 
smokers had similar blood concentrations of VOCs. Blood concentrations of 
Benzene, Furan, and Isobutyronitrile were significant higher in 
combustible-cigarette smokers than in E-cigarette smokers. In the multivariable 
regression model, dual-smoking and combustible-cigarette smoking were associated 
with elevated blood concentrations of several VOCs except 1,4-Dichlorobenzene, 
while E-cigarette smoking was only associated with elevated 2,5-Dimethylfuran 
concentration.
CONCLUSIONS: Smoking, mainly dual-smoking and combustible-cigarette smoking, is 
associated with elevated blood concentration of VOCs, while the effect is weak 
in E-cigarette smoking.

The World Health Organisation called for research assessing the safety of 
electronic cigarette (e-cigarette). We evaluated the acute effect of active and 
passive e-cigarette and tobacco cigarette smoking on complete blood count (CBC) 
markers in 15 smokers and 15 never-smokers, respectively. Smokers underwent a 
control session, an active tobacco cigarette smoking session, and an active 
e-cigarette smoking session. Never-smokers underwent a control session, a 
passive tobacco cigarette smoking session, and a passive e-cigarette smoking 
session. The results demonstrated that CBC indices remained unchanged during the 
control session and the active and passive e-cigarette smoking sessions 
(P>0.05). Active and passive tobacco cigarette smoking increased white blood 
cell, lymphocyte, and granulocyte counts for at least one hour in smokers and 
never smokers (P<0.05). It is concluded that acute active and passive smoking 
using the e-cigarettes tested in the current study does not influence CBC 
indices in smokers and never smokers, respectively. In contrast, acute active 
and passive tobacco cigarette smoking increase the secondary proteins of acute 
inflammatory load for at least one hour. More research is needed to evaluate 
chemical safety issues and other areas of consumer product safety of 
e-cigarettes, because the nicotine content in the liquids used may vary 
considerably.

pneumoniae infection.

There is growing evidence that vaping has the potential to cause adverse health 
effects. Vaping is affecting the younger and healthier population which is a 
public concern. Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia is a benign condition and is 
usually underdiagnosed and is managed in an outpatient setting. Here we present 
a case of fulminant MPP in a young adult probably associated with VAPI. A 
24-year-old woman presented to our hospital for severe hypoxic respiratory 
failure needing intubation and intensive care unit admission. She had a history 
for vaping for 2 years prior to presentation. She had fever and an elevated 
white count. Her Chest X-Ray and CT scan of the chest were consistent with 
bilateral predominantly lower lobe patchy opacities. She had mildly elevated 
serum LDH and Urine toxicology screen was positive for THC. Serum IgM Mycoplasma 
level was positive and her BAL fluid analysis showed lipid-laden macrophages. 
She was diagnosed as a probable case of VAPI per CDC guidelines with 
superimposed fulminant MPP. Vaping is known to increase the risk of viral and 
bacterial pneumonia by compromising the respiratory local immune response. 
Vaping also causes lipoid pneumonia where the alveoli are filled with 
lipid-laden macrophages with surrounding inflammation. We hypothesize that this 
patient had fulminant MPP in the setting of background VAPI. The association 
between vaping and MPP infection has not been established in the literature and 
this is the first documented report to establish a link between e-cigarettes and 
fulminant MPP. Further research is needed to confirm this association.

The effect of smoking and nicotine exposure during pregnancy on fetal 
nephrogenesis is a growing area of research. The objective of this systematic 
review is to summarise the current evidence in this research field. Our 
literature search identified a total of 415 articles from PubMed, Embase, 
Scopus, and Cochrane. After electronic sorting and manual screening, 18 eligible 
articles were found, 6 being human studies and 12 being animal studies. Articles 
that did not study nicotine or smoking, did not focus on fetal kidney 
development, or did not include nicotine or smoking exposure during pregnancy 
were excluded from the systematic review. The main outcomes of the studies were 
kidney weight, volume and size, kidney histopathology and morphology, and kidney 
function. Evidence from human studies identified a reduction in fetal kidney 
size, volume, and weight in offspring exposed to smoking during pregnancy; and 
the greatest impact was seen in offspring exposed to >5-10 cigarettes per day. 
Animal studies investigated kidney histopathology and highlighted kidney injury 
and microscopic changes in response to nicotine exposure during pregnancy. 
Further research is required to determine the impact on kidney function. 
Recreational nicotine use is evolving, and with the increasing use of urine 
cotinine in the evaluation of nicotine exposure, further research is needed.

OBJECTIVE: This study examined caregiver perception of harm and child secondhand 
exposure to nicotine in a sample of e-cigarette-exclusive, cigarette-exclusive, 
and non-tobacco/nicotine users (non-users).
METHODS: Cigarette-exclusive (n = 19), e-cigarette-exclusive (n = 12), and 
non-users (n = 20) and their children (N = 51, Mage  = 10.47) completed 
self-report questionnaires about perceptions of harm, child secondhand exposure, 
and provided urine to assess child nicotine exposure (cotinine). ANOVAs examined 
differences between caregiver use status on tobacco harm perceptions and child 
cotinine levels. Independent samples t-test compared differences in 
caregiver-reported child secondhand exposure in the home and car.
RESULTS: All 3 caregiver groups rated cigarettes as highly harmful (P = .14), 
but e-cigarette users rated all 3 types of e-cigarette products 
(Cartridge-based: P < .001; Tank: P < .001; Box Mod: P < .001) as less harmful 
than cigarette users and non-users. Caregivers from the e-cigarette user group 
reported greater child secondhand exposure than caregivers using cigarettes 
(past 7-day in-home exposure (P = .03); past 7-day exposure in-home + in-car 
exposure (P = .02); in-home exposure by caregivers and other people exposure 
(P = .02)). Children from the cigarette user group had significantly higher 
levels of cotinine (M = 16.6, SD = 21.7) compared to children from the Non-User 
group (M = .43, SD = .95; P = .001), but no significant difference when compared 
to children from the E-Cigarette User group (M = 6.5, SD = 13.5).
DISCUSSION: In this sample, caregivers who used e-cigarettes perceived them as 
less harmful, reported using them more frequently at home and in the car, even 
when their children were present, compared to cigarette users. As a result, 
children appear to be exposed to nicotine at levels similar to children living 
with cigarette users. Future caregiver prevention and intervention efforts 
should target education around the potential harms of secondhand e-cigarette 
aerosol to children.

The endothelium regulates and mediates vascular homeostasis, allowing for 
dynamic changes of blood flow in response to mechanical and chemical stimuli. 
Endothelial dysfunction underlies many diseases and is purported to be the 
earliest pathologic change in the progression of atherosclerotic disease. 
Peripheral vascular function can be interrogated by measuring the response 
kinetics following induced ischemia or exercise. In the presence of endothelial 
dysfunction, there is a blunting and delay of the hyperemic response, which can 
be measured non-invasively using a variety of quantitative magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) methods. In this review, we summarize recent developments in 
non-contrast, proton MRI for dynamic quantification of blood flow and 
oxygenation. Methodologic description is provided for: blood oxygenation-level 
dependent (BOLD) signal that reflect combined effect of blood flow and capillary 
bed oxygen content; arterial spin labeling (ASL) for quantification of regional 
perfusion; phase contrast (PC) to quantify arterial flow waveforms and 
macrovascular blood flow velocity and rate; high-resolution MRI for luminal 
flow-mediated dilation; and dynamic MR oximetry to quantify oxygen saturation. 
Overall, results suggest that these dynamic and quantitative MRI methods can 
detect endothelial dysfunction both in the presence of overt cardiovascular 
disease (such as in patients with peripheral artery disease), as well as in 
sub-clinical settings (i.e., in chronic smokers, non-smokers exposed to 
e-cigarette aerosol, and as a function of age). Thus far, these tools have been 
relegated to the realm of research, used as biomarkers of disease progression 
and therapeutic response. With proper validation, MRI-measures of vascular 
function may ultimately be used to complement the standard clinical workup, 
providing additional insight into the optimal treatment strategy and evaluation 
of treatment efficacy.

2-isopropyl-N,2,3-trimethylbutyramide (WS-23) is a well-known artificial 
synthesis cooling agent widely used in foods, medicines, and tobaccos. As a 
commonly cooling agent in e-cigarette liquids, WS-23 has led to concerns about 
the inhalation toxicity with the prosperous of e-cigarettes in recent years. 
Thus, the aim of this study is to assess the acute and subacute inhalation 
toxicity of WS-23 in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats according to the Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) guidelines. In the acute toxicity 
study, there was no mortality and behavioral signs of toxicity at the limit test 
dose level (340.0 mg/m3 ) in the exposure period and the following 14-day 
observation period. In the subacute inhalation toxicity study, there was no 
significant difference observed in the body weights, feed consumption, and 
relative organ weights. Haematological, serum biochemical, urine, and 
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) analysis revealed the non-adverse effects 
after 28-day repeated WS-23 inhalation (342.85 mg/m3 ), accompanied by slight 
changes in few parameters which returned to normal during the 28-day recovery 
period. The histopathologic examination also did not show any differences in 
vital organs. In conclusion, the maximum tolerated dose for WS-23 acute 
inhalation is not less than 340.0 mg/m3 , and the No Observed Adverse Effect 
Level (NOAEL) of WS-23 subacute inhalation was determined to be over 
342.85 mg/m3 .

The use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) is increasing despite 
insufficient information concerning their long-term effects, including the 
effects of maternal e-cigarette use on pre- and postnatal development. Our 
previous study demonstrated that developmental exposure to 1,2-propanediol (a 
principal component of e-cigarette liquid) affected early development of 
zebrafish, causing reduced growth, deformities, and hyperactive swimming 
behavior in larvae. The current study extends assessment of the developmental 
toxicity of 1,2-propanediol by examining additional long-term behavioral 
effects. We demonstrate that embryonic/larval exposure of zebrafish to 
1,2-propanediol (0.625% or 1.25%) not only affected behavioral parameters in the 
larvae, but also caused persisting behavioral effects in adults after early 
developmental exposure. Additional parameters, including neural and vascular 
development in larvae, stress response in adults, and concentration of 
neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin in adult brain were examined, in order 
to explain the behavioral differences. These additional assessments did not find 
1,2-propanediol exposure to significantly affect Tg(Neurog1:GFP) or the 
transcript abundance of neural genes (Neurog1, Ascl1a, Elavl3, and Lef1). 
Vascular development was not found to be affected by 1,2-propanediol exposure, 
as inferred from experiments with Tg(Flk1:eGFP) zebrafish; however, transcript 
abundance of vascular genes (Flk1, Vegf, Tie-2, and Angpt1) was decreased. No 
statistically significant changes were noted for plasma cortisol or brain 
neurotransmitters in adult fish. Lastly, analysis of gene transcripts involved 
with 1,2-propanediol metabolism (Adh5, Aldh2.1, and Ldha) showed an increase in 
Adh5 transcript. This is the first study to demonstrate that developmental 
exposure to 1,2-propanediol has long-term neurobehavioral consequences in adult 
zebrafish, showing that e-cigarettes contain substances potentially harmful to 
neurodevelopment.

It is known that cigarette smoking is correlated with medical associated 
inquires. New electronic cigarettes are intensively advertised as an alternative 
to conventional smoking, but only a few studies demonstrate their harmful 
potential. A cross-sectional study was designed using 150 subjects from Brasov 
(Romania), divided into three groups: non-smokers (NS = 58), conventional 
cigarettes smokers (CS = 58) and electronic cigarettes users (ECS = 34). The aim 
of this study was to determine levels of some plasma lipophilic and 
hematological components, and the total antioxidant status that could be 
associated with the smoking status of the subjects. Serum low density 
lipoproteins (LDL) cholesterol increased significantly for ECS participants 
versus NS group (18.9% difference) (p < 0.05). Also, the CS group is 
characterized by an increase of serum LDL cholesterol (7.9% difference vs. NS), 
but with no significant statistical difference. The variation of median values 
of serum very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) was in order NS < ECS < CS, with 
statistical difference between NS and CS groups (34.6% difference; p = 0.023). 
When comparing the antioxidant status of the three groups, significant 
differences (p < 0.05) were obtained between NS vs. CS and NS vs. ECS. Similar 
behavior was identified for CS and ECS. Statistically significant changes (p < 
0.0001) for both vitamin A and vitamin E were identified in the blood of NS vs. 
CS and NS vs. ECS, and also when comparing vitamin A in the blood of the CS 
group versus the ECS group (p < 0.05). When all groups were compared, the 
difference in the white blood cell (WBC) was (p = 0.008). A slight increase in 
the red blood cell (RBC) count was observed, but with no statistical difference 
between groups. These results indicated that conventional cigarette and 
e-cigarette usage promotes the production of excess reactive oxygen species, 
involving different pathways, different antioxidants and bioactive molecules.

Nicotine of unprecedented concentrations and purity is being inhaled by those 
using commercially available electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS). The 
consequences of this route of self-administration on the immunological response 
to inhaled allergens are not known. In mice, sensitization and inhalation 
challenge with the common environmental house dust mite (HDM) allergen is an 
experimental model of this response. When mice were exposed to aerosolized 
nicotine base (aeroNic) twice daily, 5 days/wk for 8 wk, the HDM-induced 
recruitment of eosinophils (EOS) was substantially reduced as measured in 
bronchial alveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Oral nicotine administration had no 
effect. HDM challenge in the presence of nicotinic receptor subtype α7 
(α7)-specific type-1 positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) was alone sufficient 
to suppress EOS. RNA analysis of alveolar macrophages (AM) collected from BALF 
after HDM challenge of aeroNic revealed that α7 activation strongly suppresses 
initiation of Ccl24 (eotaxin 2) transcription. To examine possible cellular 
signaling mechanisms coupling α7 to Ccl24 transcription, an AM culture model 
system was used. In AM cultures of freshly collected BALF, Ccl24 transcription 
was robustly activated by a mixture of IL-4 and IL-10, and this was suppressed 
by coapplication of type-1 PAMs through a pathway that requires p38MAPK but is 
independent of Jak2. These results suggest that the EOS response to HDM inhaled 
allergen is subject to modulation through activation of the α7 receptor and 
suggest that the allergic response may be substantially modified in ENDS users.

BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer are diseases 
associated with smoking tobacco cigarettes. Smokers find cessation difficult.
OBJECTIVES: To determine whether smoking the Twisp electronic cigarette 
(e-cigarette), containing nicotine in a vegetable-based glycerine substance, 
would reduce carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb) levels in regular cigarette smokers by 
(i) comparing arterial and venous COHb levels before and after smoking the Twisp 
e-cigarette for 2 weeks; and (ii) evaluating changes in participants' perception 
of their health and lifestyle following the use of Twisp e-cigarettes.
METHODS: A single group within-subject design was used where tobacco cigarette 
smokers converted to Twisp e-cigarettes for 2 weeks. Prior to using the Twisp 
e-cigarette and after using this device for 2 weeks, arterial COHb, venous COHb 
and venous cotinine levels were determined. Additionally, the participants were 
asked to complete a questionnaire outlining their perceptions on health and 
lifestyle.
RESULTS: Thirteen participants of median age 38 years (range 23 - 46) with a 
smoking median of 20 cigarettes/day (range 12 - 30) completed the study. COHb 
levels (%) were significantly reduced after smoking Twisp e-cigarettes for 2 
weeks (mean ± standard deviation (SD) arterial COHb before 4.66±1.99 v. after 
2.46±1.35; p=0.014 and mean ±SD venous COHb before 4.37±2.1 v. after 2.50±1.23; 
p=0.018). There was excellent agreement between arterial and venous COHb levels 
(intraclass correlation coefficient 0.916). A decrease in cotinine levels 
(p=0.001) and an increase in oxygen saturation (p=0.002) were also observed. The 
majority of participants perceived improvements in their health and lifestyle 
parameters.
CONCLUSION: Smoking the Twisp e-cigarette may be a healthier and more acceptable 
alternative to smoking tobacco cigarettes.

INTRODUCTION: The circadian pattern of blood pressure is characterized by a 
physiological drop occurring after sleep onset. The alteration of this 
phenomenon (non-dipping, extreme dipping, or reverse dipping) is associated with 
an increased cardiovascular risk. Besides altered autonomic and endocrine 
circadian rhythms, psychological aspects seem to play a role in this 
modification. However, the few studies that have analyzed the influence of 
psychological dimensions on the dipping phenomenon have reported inconsistent 
results. This study aimed to examine the relationship between anger expression 
and blood pressure (BP) dipping.
METHODS: We obtained 24 h ambulatory BP measurements from 151 participants and 
used them to define three groups according to their dipping status: Dippers (N = 
65), Non-Dippers (N = 42), and Extreme Dippers (N = 44). Sociodemographic and 
anamnestic information was collected, and the State-Trait Anger Expression 
Inventory was used to assess anger.
RESULTS: Analysis of variance evidenced significant higher scores for Trait 
Anger Temperament and Anger Expression in Extreme Dippers than in both Dippers 
and Non-Dippers. However, after controlling for confounding variables, there was 
no significant relationship with trait anger, and only the result concerning the 
suppression of anger was confirmed.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the analysis of some psychological 
factors, such as anger, could be necessary to better understand differences in 
nocturnal BP alterations. Trait anger and suppression of anger may contribute to 
the description and classification of patients who exhibit a maladaptive dipping 
phenomenon. However, modifiable (i.e., cigarette consumption) and unmodifiable 
(i.e., age) risk factors appear to mediate this relationship. Although further 
studies are necessary to explore this association, these results highlight that 
some aspects of anger can represent risk factors or markers of maladaptive 
modulation of the dipping phenomenon.

Menthol is a commonly used flavorant in tobacco and e-cigarettes, and could 
contribute to nicotine sensitivity. To understand how menthol could contribute 
to nicotine intake and addiction, it is important to determine whether specific 
mechanisms related to sex and age could underlie behavioral changes induced by 
menthol-laced nicotinic products. Using a validated paradigm of 
nicotine-dependent locomotor stimulation, adolescent and adult C57BL/6J mice of 
both sexes were exposed to nicotine, or nicotine laced with menthol, as their 
sole source of fluid, and psychostimulant effects were evaluated by recording 
home cage locomotor activity for ten days. Nicotine and cotinine blood levels 
were measured following exposure. Results show an interaction between treatment, 
age, and sex on liquid consumption, indicating that mice responded differently 
to menthol and nicotine based on their age and sex. Adult male mice greatly 
increased their nicotine intake when given menthol. In female mice of both age 
groups, menthol did not have this effect. Despite an increase in nicotine intake 
promoted by menthol, adult male mice showed a significant decrease in 
locomotion, suggesting that menthol blunted nicotine-induced psychostimulation. 
This behavioral response to menthol was not detected in adolescent mice of 
either sex. These data confirm that menthol is more than a flavorant, and can 
influence both nicotine intake and its psychostimulant effects. These results 
suggest that age- and sex-dependent mechanisms could underlie menthol's 
influence on nicotine intake and that studies including adolescent and adult 
menthol smokers of both sexes are warranted.

BACKGROUND: Most people believe that electric cigarettes have no negative effect 
on health,  which causes them to use it more. However, exposure to the smoke 
from these cigarettes is bad for the health and causes cell damage. Antioxidants 
play an important role in preventing cell damage, and they can be obtained 
through the oral administration of selenomethionine.
DESIGN AND METHODS: This study used an experimental method and a post-test 
control group design. Male Wistar rats, which were exposed to cigarette smoke 
were given selenomethionine orally and then tested for the presence of free 
radicals. The measurement of lung tissue damage was conducted by assessing the 
level of malondialdehyde in the blood and immunohistochemistry (IHC) of the lung 
tissue.
RESULT: The study showed that differences in the time of administration of 
selenomethionine affect the levels of malondialdehyde in the blood and 
expression of malondialdehyde in the lung tissue (p<0.05). Consequently, the two 
groups showed a strong (r=0.861) and significant (p=0.000) relationship with 
each other.
CONCLUSION: The early application of selenomethionine can prevent increased 
levels of malondialdehyde in the blood and lung tissue due to exposure to 
e-cigarette smoke.

BACKGROUND: With growing electronic cigarette usage in both the smoking and 
nonsmoking population, rigorous studies are needed to investigate the effects of 
nicotine on biological systems to determine long-term health consequences. We 
have previously shown that nicotine exerts specific neurovascular effects that 
influence blood brain barrier (BBB) function in response to stroke. In this 
study, we investigated the effects of nicotine on carrier-mediated glucose 
transport into ischemic brain. Specifically, the present study investigates 
glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1) function and expression at the BBB in a focal 
brain ischemia model of mice pre-exposed to nicotine.
METHODS: Nicotine was administrated subcutaneously by osmotic pump at the dose 
of 4.5 mg/kg/day for 1, 7, or 14 days to reflect the plasma levels seen in 
smokers. Ischemic-reperfusion (IR) injury was induced by 1 h transient middle 
cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) and 24 h reperfusion. Glucose transport was 
estimated using an in situ brain perfusion technique with radiolabeled glucose 
and brain vascular GLUT1 expression was detected with immunofluorescence.
RESULTS: The nicotine pre-exposure (1, 7 & 14 day) resulted in significant 
reduction in D-glucose influx rate (K in ) across the BBB, with a 49% reduction 
in 14 day nicotine-infused animals. We observed a 41% increase in 
carrier-mediated glucose transport across the BBB in saline-infused tMCAO 
animals compared to saline-infused sham animals. Interestingly, in the tMCAO 
group of animals pre-exposed to nicotine for 14 days had significantly 
attenuated increased glucose transport by 80% and 38% compared to saline-infused 
tMCAO and sham animals respectively. Furthermore, immunofluorescence studies of 
GLUT1 protein expression in the brain microvascular endothelium confirmed that 
GLUT1 was also induced in saline-infused tMCAO animals and this protein 
expression induction was reduced significantly (P < 0.01) with 14 day nicotine 
pre-exposure in tMCAO animals.
CONCLUSIONS: Nicotine pre-exposure reduced the IR-enhanced GLUT1 transporter 
function and expression at the BBB in a focal brain ischemia mouse model. These 
studies suggest that nicotine exposure prior to stroke could create an enhanced 
glucose deprived state at the neurovascular unit (NVU) and could provide an 
additional vulnerability to enhanced stroke injury.

In relation to antiasthmatic treatment of hospitalized patients with 
theophyllines, results concerning: a) a retrospective analysis of plasma levels 
observed over a 18-month period; b) a pharmacokinetic study and consequent 
determination of an efficient individual posology are reported. On the 194 serum 
drug tests (each comprehensive of the trough and peak concentrations) evaluated, 
58 (30%) entered the retrospective study, after screening by predetermined 
criteria. 96 out of 194 (49%) tests were eliminated because of inappropriate 
sample collection or irrational dosage regimen. The theophylline blood levels, 
distinguished by drug formulation and posology, were spread over very large 
ranges (coefficient of variation up to 88%, mean of 55%), so that many 
concentrations were subtherapeutic or potentially toxic. The kinetic study, 
undergone by 22 patients, was carried out by administering and intravenous 
test-dose of aminophylline, followed by collection of blood samples at 
determined times. Elimination half-life, clearance and volume of distribution 
were then calculated by means of the plasma theophylline concentrations and 
subsequently an individual optimized dosage regimen (so as to keep the blood 
drug levels within the 8-16 mg.l-1 range) was determined. The considerable 
variability of elimination rate observed among patients (extreme values of 
half-life and clearance differ 10-fold) mainly account for the unforeseeability 
of plasma levels obtainable with a given posology. Even if the factors affecting 
the elimination rate of theophylline (i.e. cigarette smoking, obesity, 
congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia) are 
taken into account, the blood concentrations are frequently unforeseeable. 
Therefore, the monitoring of plasma levels is necessary for every patient 
treated with theophyllines and a pharmacokinetic study is desirable in some 
cases.

BACKGROUND: Though rates of tobacco smoking have decreased consistently over the 
past 3 decades, cigarette use remains the top preventable cause of premature 
death in North America. The Clinical Effort Against Secondhand Smoke Exposure 
(CEASE) is a medical clinic-based intervention that systematically screens 
parents for tobacco use and offers them direct access to evidence-based smoking 
cessation services. While the effectiveness of CEASE for parents who smoke has 
already been demonstrated in the United States, the CEASE model has not yet been 
tested in Canada, among parents who use e-cigarettes, or among adolescents who 
use cigarettes and e-cigarettes.
OBJECTIVE: We aim to demonstrate the feasibility and evaluate the preliminary 
effectiveness of the CEASE program for parental smoking cessation and its 
adapted version for adolescent smoking cessation and adolescent and parental 
vaping cessation.
METHODS: We will approach parents or guardians of children aged between 0 and 17 
years, as well as adolescent patients aged between 14 and 17 years, from a 
tertiary care pediatric hospital in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, for participation 
in this single-blinded, pilot randomized controlled trial. Eligible participants 
are those who report using tobacco cigarettes or e-cigarettes at least once in 
the last 7 days and present to an outpatient pediatric clinic for a scheduled 
appointment. Our recruitment target is 100 participants: 50 parents or guardians 
of children aged 17 years or younger, and 50 adolescents aged between 14 and 17 
years. The feasibility of implementation of the CEASE model will be measured by 
recruitment and retention rates for all 4 participant groups (stratified as 
follows: parents who use cigarettes, parents who use e-cigarettes exclusively, 
adolescents who use cigarettes, and adolescents who use e-cigarettes 
exclusively). Parent and adolescent participants within each group are 
randomized to the intervention and control groups using a 1:1 ratio through a 
computer-generated randomization list. Preliminary effectiveness outcomes 
include self-reported smoking and e-cigarette cessation, use of cessation 
resources, changes in smoking and e-cigarette use, motivation to quit, and quit 
attempts among participants. Participants complete electronic questionnaires on 
a tablet in the clinic at baseline as well as electronic follow-up 
questionnaires at 1, 3, and 6 months. Individuals reporting successful quit 
attempts are invited to provide a urine sample for cotinine testing to 
biochemically confirm quit. Analyses include descriptive statistics as well as 
exploratory trajectory analyses of smoking, e-cigarette use, and motivation to 
quit.
RESULTS: Research activities began in June 2022. Participant enrollment and data 
collection began in February 2023 and are expected to be completed in 15 months.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a strong need for effective and cost-effective smoking and 
vaping cessation interventions for parents and adolescents. If successful, this 
study will help inform the preparation of a fully powered randomized controlled 
trial of CEASE in Canada in these populations.

CONTEXT: Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are becoming increasingly popular 
yet their effects on health remain unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To conduct the first comprehensive and standardized assessment of the 
acute impact of active and passive e-cigarette smoking on serum cotinine and 
lung function, as compared to active and passive tobacco cigarette smoking.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen smokers (≥15 cigarettes/day; seven females; eight 
males) and 15 never-smokers (seven females; eight males) completed this 
repeated-measures controlled study. Smokers underwent a control session, an 
active tobacco cigarette (their favorite brand) smoking session and an active 
e-cigarette smoking session. Never-smokers underwent a control session, a 
passive tobacco cigarette smoking session and a passive e-cigarette smoking 
session. Serum cotinine, lung function, exhaled carbon monoxide and nitric oxide 
were assessed. The level of significance was set at p ≤ 0.001 to adjust for 
multiple comparisons.
RESULTS: e-Cigarettes and tobacco cigarettes generated similar (p > 0.001) 
effects on serum cotinine levels after active (60.6 ± 34.3 versus 
61.3 ± 36.6 ng/ml) and passive (2.4 ± 0.9 versus 2.6 ± 0.6 ng/ml) smoking. 
Neither a brief session of active e-cigarette smoking (indicative: 3% reduction 
in FEV1/FVC) nor a 1 h passive e-cigarette smoking (indicative: 2.3% reduction 
in FEV1/FVC) significantly affected the lung function (p > 0.001). In contrast, 
active (indicative: 7.2% reduction in FEV1/FVC; p < 0.001) but not passive 
(indicative: 3.4% reduction in FEV1/FVC; p = 0.005) tobacco cigarette smoking 
undermined lung function.
CONCLUSION: Regarding short-term usage, the studied e-cigarettes generate 
smaller changes in lung function but similar nicotinergic impact to tobacco 
cigarettes. Future research should target the health effects of long-term 
e-cigarette usage, including the effects of nicotine dosage.

The metabolic syndrome is a combination of several metabolic disorders, such as 
cardiovascular disease, atherosclerosis, and type 2 diabetes. Lifestyle 
modifications, including quitting smoking, are recommended to reduce the risk of 
metabolic syndrome and its associated complications. Not much research has been 
conducted in the field of e-cigarettes and the risk of metabolic syndrome. 
Furthermore, taking into account the influence of e-cigarettes vaping on the 
individual components of metabolic syndrome, i.e, abdominal obesity, insulin 
resistance, dyslipidemia and elevated arterial blood pressure, the results are 
also ambiguous. This article is a review and summary of existing reports on the 
impact of e-cigarettes on the development of metabolic syndrome as well as its 
individual components. A critical review for English language articles published 
until 30 June 2020 was made, using a PubMed (including MEDLINE), Cochrane, 
CINAHL Plus, and Web of Science data. The current research indicated that 
e-cigarettes use does not affect the development of insulin resistance, but 
could influence the level of glucose and pre-diabetic state development. The 
lipid of profile an increase in the TG level was reported, while the influence 
on the level of concentration of total cholesterol, LDL fraction, and HDL 
fraction differed. In most cases, e-cigarettes use increased the risk of 
developing abdominal obesity or higher arterial blood pressure. Further research 
is required to provide more evidence on this topic.

Electronic cigarettes may increase the risk of long-term cardiovascular 
morbidity. To protect the heart, awareness should be raised of the risks and 
limits of E-cigarette aerosol exposure. Thus, this systematic review and 
meta-analysis assessed the cardiovascular risk of e-smoking. This systematic 
review was conducted by using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement. We searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, 
Web of Science, and Science Direct databases in December 2022 to identify 
studies investigating e-cigarettes' impact on the heart. The study was supported 
by meta-analysis and qualitative review. Out of the initial 493 papers, only 15 
met the inclusion criteria and were included in the study. The cumulative number 
of participants in the myocardial infarction (MI) group was 85,420, and in the 
sympathetic groups in whom the systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood 
pressure (DBP), mean blood pressure (MBP), and heart rate (HR) were measured, 
were 332 cigarette smokers. The control group included the "never use," 
"non-smokers," and "never smoke." The pooled analysis showed a significant 
difference between the e-cigarette smokers and the control group regarding the 
risk of developing MI in former smokers (OR= 0.12; 95% CI: 0.01-1.72, P = 0.12) 
and never smoked (OR= 0.02; 95% CI: 0.00-0.44, P = 0.01) favoring the control 
group. The pooled analysis of the included studies showed a significant 
difference between the e-cigarette smokers with nicotine and the control group 
regarding the mean difference (MD) of the SBP (MD = 2.89; 95% CI: 1.94-3.84; P < 
0.001), the DBP (MD = 3.10; 95% CI: 0.42-5.78; P = 0.02), the MBP (MD = 7.05; 
95% CI: 2.70-1.40; P = 0.001), and HF (MD = 3.13; 95% CI: 0.96-5.29; P = 0.005) 
favoring the control group. We conclude that using e-cigarettes has a 
detrimental effect on cardiac health. The risk of severe cardiac conditions 
increases with e-cigarettes. Thus, vaping can do more harm than good. 
Consequently, the misleading notion that e-cigarettes are less harmful should be 
challenged.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate nicotine delivery from the NJOY® King Bold Electronic 
Nicotine Delivery System (ENDS) and its short-term potential for smoking 
reduction or cessation.
METHODS: One week of ad libitum use was followed by measurements of plasma 
nicotine, heart rate, and craving and withdrawal after 12 hours of nicotine 
abstinence in 25 adult smokers not interested in quitting.
RESULTS: After 5 minutes of use, blood nicotine levels increased by a mean of 
3.5 ng/mL (p < .001), heart rate increased, and craving was reduced by 55%. 
Cigarettes per day were reduced by 39% during the test week, and perceptions of 
use for reduction or cessation were positive.
CONCLUSIONS: The NJOY® King Bold ENDS delivers nicotine and led to short-term 
smoking reduction.

Recently Health Canada and the Food and Drug Administration warned about the 
cardiovascular risk of testosterone, making environmental drivers of 
testosterone potential prevention targets. Cotinine, a tobacco metabolite, 
inhibits testosterone breakdown. We assessed the association of smoking with 
testosterone in a systematic review and meta-analysis, searching PubMed and Web 
of Science through March 2015 using ("testosterone" or "androgen" or "sex 
hormone") and ("smoking" or "cigarette"). Two reviewers independently searched, 
selected, assessed quality and abstracted with differences resolved by consensus 
or reference to a third reviewer. The initial search yielded 2881 studies; 28 
met the selection criteria. In 22 studies of 13,317 men, mean age 18-61years, 
smokers had higher mean testosterone than non-smokers (1.53nmol/L, 95% 
confidence interval (CI) 1.11 to 1.96) using a random effects model with inverse 
variance weighting. In 6 studies of 6089 women, mean age 28-62years, smoking was 
not clearly associated with testosterone (0.11nmol/L, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.30). 
Fixed effects models provided similar results, but suggested a positive 
association in women. Whether products which raise cotinine, such as 
e-cigarettes or nicotine replacement, also raise testosterone, should be 
investigated, to inform any regulatory action for e-cigarettes, which emit 
nicotine into the surrounding air, with relevance for both active and passive 
smokers.

INTRODUCTION: This study investigated the association between smoking types, 
including dual use (usage of both combustible cigarettes and e-cigarettes), and 
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) status in Korean men.
METHODS: Data from the 7th and 8th Korea National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey (KNHANES) 2016-2020 were used. The presence of NAFLD was 
defined by the respective cut-off values for the Hepatic Steatosis Index (HSI), 
NAFLD Ridge Score (NRS), and Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination 
Survey NAFLD score (KNS). Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to 
determine the associations between smoking types and NAFLD as determined by HSI, 
NRS, and KNS.
RESULTS: After adjustment for confounders, an independent association was 
observed between dual use and NAFLD (HSI: AOR=1.47; 95% CI: 1.08-1.99, p=0.014; 
NRS: AOR=2.21; 95% CI: 1.70-2.86, p=0.000; KNS: AOR=1.35; 95% CI: 1.01-1.81, 
p=0.045). Cigarette only smokers also had significantly higher odds of NAFLD 
compared to never smokers for all of the NAFLD indices (HSI: AOR=1.22; 95% CI: 
1.05-1.42, p=0.008; NRS: AOR=2.13; 95% CI: 1.87-2.42, p=0.000; KNS: AOR=1.33; 
95% CI: 1.14-1.55, p=0.000). In subgroup analyses, no significant interaction 
effects were found for age, BMI, alcohol consumption, income, physical activity, 
and the diagnosis of T2DM. Moreover, cigarette only smokers and dual users 
differed significantly in terms of log-transformed urine cotinine and 
pack-years. The relationship between smoking type and pack-years was attenuated 
after stratification by age.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that the dual use of e-cigarettes and combustible 
cigarettes is associated with NAFLD. Age differences may explain why dual users, 
with a greater proportion of young people, appear to have fewer pack-years than 
cigarette only smokers. Further research should be conducted to investigate the 
adverse effects of dual use on hepatic steatosis.

Nicotine is a potent neurotoxin alkaloid and is used in e-cigarette liquid. The 
LC/MS/MS method was linear over 0.01-1.0 mg/L (r2 = 0.992-0.995). Limit of 
detection and limit of quantitation were 0.001 mg/L (S/N = 3) and 0.003 (S/N = 
10). The inaccuracy and imprecision were <13.2%. The recoveries were >99.3%. A 
39-year-old dentist was found dead lying on the floor under the couch in his 
dental clinic. The concentration of nicotine, cotinine, and 
trans-3'-hydroxycotinine (heart blood/peripheral blood) was analyzed as follows: 
87.2/85.2 mg/L (ratio 1.0), 1.4/1.1 mg/L (ratio 1.3), and 0.012/0.0089 mg/L 
(ratio 1.3), respectively. The concentration of nicotine was determined to be 
6734.8 mg/kg in gastric contents and 7262.0 mg/L in remaining e-liquid. Only, 
high concentration of nicotine was detected in the gastric contents as well as 
the two pieces of evidence collected from the death scene. This fatal case 
resulted from oral ingestion of e-cigarette liquid. It is estimated that at 
least 714 mg of nicotine was orally ingested.

A relatively new device, described by producers as a device to help smokers 
quit, nicotine inhaler is an electronic (e-cigarette). Its mission is to provide 
the body with small doses of nicotine behavior "ceremonial" burning product is 
not tested for efficacy and toxicity The aim of this study was to compare the 
effects of nicotine absorbed from cigarette conventional and electronic changes 
in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate. Because of the 
potential interaction of carbon monoxide contained in cigarette smoke and 
nicotine conventional to changes on the parameters is also going to examine 
changes in the concentration of carboxyhemoglobin after smoking cigarettes and 
using e-cigarettes. study group consisted of 42 people, including 21 women and 
21 men aged from 18 to 62 years who declared daily cigarette smoking. In this 
study it was found that as a result of cigarette smoking are increasing all the 
analyzed conventional hemodynamic parameters, these increases probably normally 
associated with nicotine absorbed by the smoker with the smoke. It was also a 
clear increase in carboxyhemoglobin, which is associated with a high 
concentration of carbon monoxide in cigarette smoke. If you use the e-cigarettes 
tested were observed increases in diastolic blood pressure and pulse, but none 
of the parameters did not change significantly, indicating that either the use 
of e-cigarette by the respondents did not supply the body with absorbable 
nicotine or for the increase in haemodynamic parameters studied did not 
correspond only nicotine but also other smoke constituents that interact with 
nicotine to the smoker body as carbon monoxide.

Greater understanding of development and dissipation of acute tolerance to 
nicotine may help explain temporal patterns of nicotine self-administration in 
smokers. The time course of dissipation of acute tolerance to nicotine was 
examined in 16 smokers (8M, 8F) participating in four sessions differing on 
pretreatment exposure or time interval prior to nicotine (20 micrograms/kg) 
challenge: placebo 30 min before, or nicotine (20 micrograms/kg) 30, 60, or 120 
min before challenge. Nicotine and placebo were administered by measured-dose 
nasal spray. The measurement battery consisted of subjective, cardiovascular, 
thermal pain detection, and behavioral performance measures. Results 
demonstrated significant acute tolerance (i.e. smaller responses to nicotine 
challenge following nicotine versus placebo pretreatment) for most subjective 
measures and for heart rate. Acute tolerance dissipated with lengthening 
inter-dose interval for two subjective measures, dose strength and arousal, but 
there was no tolerance dissipation for other measures. In contrast, nicotine 
pretreatment resulted in acute sensitization of finger temperature 
(vasoconstriction) response, which dissipated with lengthening interval. No 
acute tolerance was observed for thermal pain detection or performance measures. 
These findings demonstrate that acute tolerance develops quickly to some 
subjective and cardiovascular effects of nicotine. However, acute tolerance to 
most effects did not dissipate over 2 h, suggesting that, following acute 
tolerance development during initial exposure, most smokers generally obtain 
similar magnitude of effects from each subsequent nicotine exposure (i.e. 
cigarettes smoked later in the day).

Activated neutrophils secrete hypochlorous acid (HOCl) into the extracellular 
space of inflamed tissues. Because of short diffusion distance in biological 
fluids, HOCl-damaging effect is restricted to the extracellular compartment. The 
current study aimed at investigating the ability of nicotine, a component of 
tobacco and electronic cigarettes, to mediate HOCl-induced intracellular damage. 
We report, for the first time, that HOCl reacts with nicotine to produce 
nicotine chloramine (Nic-Cl). Nic-Cl caused dose-dependent damage to 
proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a nuclear protein, in cultured 
mammalian lung and kidney cells. Vitamin C, vitamin E analogue (Trolox), 
glutathione, and N-acetyl-L-cysteine inhibited the Nic-Cl-induced PCNA damage, 
implicating oxidation in PCNA damage. These findings point out the ability of 
nicotine to mediate HOCl-induced intracellular damage and suggest antioxidants 
as protective measures. The results also raise the possibility that Nic-Cl can 
be created in the inflamed tissues of tobacco and electronic cigarette smokers 
and may contribute to smoking-related diseases.

PURPOSE: In recent years e-liquids used in electronic cigarettes have become an 
attractive alternative to smoking tobacco. A new trend is the use of e-liquids 
containing synthetic cannabinoids (SCs) instead of smoking cannabis or herbal 
mixtures laced with SCs. In the frame of a systematic monitoring of the online 
market of 'legal high' products, e-liquids from online retailers who also sell 
herbal blends were bought.
METHODS: The products were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. In 
some of the e-liquids an unknown compound was detected which was identified as 
the SC 5F-Cumyl-PINACA 
(1-(5-fluoropentyl)-N-(2-phenylpropan-2-yl)-1H-indazole-3-carboxamide) by 
nuclear magnetic resonance analysis. To investigate the phase I metabolism of 
this new class of compounds, 5F-Cumyl-PINACA and its non-fluorinated analog 
Cumyl-PINACA were incubated with pooled human liver microsomes (pHLM). 
Cumyl-PINACA was additionally ingested orally (0.6 mg) by a volunteer in a 
controlled self-experiment. To assess the relative potency of Cumyl-PINACA a set 
of SCs were characterized using a cAMP assay.
RESULTS: Metabolism of 5F-Cumyl-PINACA and Cumyl-PINACA showed similarities with 
AM-2201 and JWH-018. The main metabolites were formed by hydroxylation at the 
N-pentyl side chain. The main metabolites detected in the volunteer's urine 
sample were the same as in the pHLM assay. All SCs tested with the cAMP assay 
were full agonists at the CB1 receptor. Cumyl-PINACA was the most potent SC 
among the tested compounds and showed an EC50 value of 0.06 nM.
CONCLUSIONS: The increasing popularity of e-liquids particularly among young 
people, and the extreme potency of the added SCs, pose a serious threat to 
public health. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the 
tentative identification of human in vivo metabolites of Cumyl-PINACA and 
5F-Cumyl-PINACA.

Cardiovascular Health Effects and Synthetic Cooling Agents in E-cigarettes 
Labeled as 'clear' Marketed in Massachusetts After the Tobacco Product Flavoring 
Ban.

Minetti ET, Erythropel HC, Keith R, Davis DR, Zimmerman JB, Krishnan-Sarin S, 
Hamburg NM.

INTRODUCTION: Massachusetts (MA) enacted statewide regulation on all flavored 
tobacco products in June 2020. Thereafter, electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) 
labeled 'clear' emerged on the market. We aimed to combine cardiovascular health 
effects with chemical analysis of 'clear' e-cigarettes.
METHODS: We measured acute changes in blood pressure and heart rate following a 
10-minute structured use of participants' own e-cigarette, comparing 'clear' 
e-cigarette users with other flavored e-cigarette users and non-users. Chemical 
characterization and quantification of relevant flavorings and cooling agents 
(WS-3, WS-23) of 19 'clear'-labeled disposable e-cigarette liquids was carried 
out by GC/MS.
RESULTS: After the ban, participants that used 'clear' labeled e-cigarettes 
increased from 0% to 21%. Increase in diastolic blood pressure and heart rate 
was significantly greater in 'clear' e-cigarettes users (n=22) compared to both 
non-'clear' flavored e-cigarette users (n=114) and non-users (n=72). We saw 
similar results in heart rate when comparing Juul e-cigarette and 'clear' users; 
Juul was used as a reference as synthetic coolants WS-3 or WS-23 were not 
detected in these.All (19/19) 'clear' e-liquids were found to contain synthetic 
cooling agents WS-23 and/or WS-3, menthol (18/19), as well as other flavorings 
(12/19).
DISCUSSION: The detected presence of menthol alongside other flavorings in 
tested 'clear' products is a direct violation of the MA flavored tobacco product 
regulation, warranting stricter monitoring for new products and constituents. 
'clear' e-cigarette use led to greater hemodynamic effects compared to other 
flavored e-cigarettes and Juul, which raises questions about the effect of 
cooling agents on users.

Most people start experimenting with tobacco products or e-cigarettes in early 
adolescence and become habitual smokers in late adolescence or adulthood. These 
studies investigated if exposure to tobacco smoke or nicotine during early and 
mid-adolescence affects nicotine intake in late adolescence and early adulthood. 
Male and female rats were exposed to tobacco smoke from low- and high-nicotine 
SPECTRUM cigarettes or nicotine (0.3 mg/kg, twice a day) from postnatal day (P) 
24-42. The self-administration sessions started at P55. The rats 
self-administered nicotine for 14-15 days under a fixed-ratio 1 schedule, and on 
the first day, the maximum number of infusions was twenty. Exposure to smoke 
from high, but not low, nicotine cigarettes during adolescence increased 
nicotine self-administration in female but not male rats. Adolescent treatment 
with nicotine facilitated nicotine self-administration. On the first day of 
nicotine self-administration, nicotine-treated rats reached the maximum number 
of infusions before the saline-treated control rats. Nicotine intake was also 
higher in the nicotine-treated female rats than in the saline-treated females. 
There was no sex difference in nicotine intake in controls when the data from 
the studies were combined. Smoke exposure led to a dose-dependent increase in 
plasma nicotine and cotinine levels in adolescent rats. Exposure to smoke from 
high-nicotine cigarettes and 0.3 mg/kg of nicotine led to plasma nicotine and 
cotinine levels that are similar to those in tobacco users. These findings 
indicate that in females, but not males, exposure to nicotine during adolescence 
may facilitate smoking and e-cigarette use later in life.

A Novel Puff Recording Electronic Nicotine Delivery System for Assessing 
Naturalistic Puff Topography and Nicotine Consumption During Ad Libitum Use: 
Ancillary Study.

BACKGROUND: Assessing the naturalistic puff topography and associated nicotine 
consumption during e-cigarette use is important as such information will not 
only unveil how these products are being consumed in real-world conditions, but 
also enable investigators and regulatory bodies to conduct quantitative, 
accurate, and realistic harmful exposure and nicotine abuse liability risk 
assessments based on actual e-cigarette use. Conventional approaches cannot 
accurately, conveniently, and noninvasively determine e-cigarette puff 
topography in a natural use environment. Thus, novel technology-enabled systems 
that do not primarily rely on self-report mechanisms or intrusive measurements 
to monitor e-cigarette product use behaviors are highly desired.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore and demonstrate the feasibility of a 
novel puff recording electronic nicotine delivery system (PR-ENDS) device for 
measuring naturalistic puff topography and estimating nicotine consumption 
during the ad libitum use of products among smokers and vapers.
METHODS: An ancillary data analysis based on a completed parent study was 
conducted. The parent study was a 1-way randomized controlled open-label puff 
topography and nicotine pharmacokinetic assessment carried out in 24 healthy 
adults (12 smokers and 12 vapers). Participants were assigned a randomized 
product use sequence of a PR-ENDS device within 5 site visits for both 
controlled and ad libitum product use sessions. Blood samples were obtained for 
plasma nicotine analysis, and questionnaires were administered at various time 
points. During the ad libitum use session, puff topography was measured using a 
Clinical Research Support System (CReSS) device as a benchmark, as well as the 
PR-ENDS device with a built-in puff recording feature.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in representative puff topography 
parameters (number of puffs, total puff duration, and average puff duration) 
between the PR-ENDS and CReSS devices at the populational level across different 
device powers, e-liquid nicotine strengths, and flavors. The nicotine 
consumption estimated by the PR-ENDS device suggested that this device can be 
employed as a convenient monitoring tool for estimating nicotine use without 
measuring e-liquid weight loss between puffs. The linear relationship between 
nicotine consumption estimated by the PR-ENDS device and the pharmacokinetic 
parameter AUCad lib (plasma concentration-time curve for 1-hour ad libitum use) 
substantiated the potential of using this device as a pragmatic, noninvasive, 
and convenient means for estimating nicotine intake in the human body without 
blood collection.
CONCLUSIONS: The novel PR-ENDS device was feasible for assessing naturalistic 
puff topography and estimating nicotine consumption and intake in the human body 
during ad libitum use. Several key factors can influence users' puff topography, 
including device power levels, e-liquid nicotine strengths, and flavors. The 
study results pave the way for further research in the real-time measurement of 
naturalistic puff topography and puffing behaviors in the real world.

Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) have the potential to provide 
nicotine to tobacco consumers while reducing exposure to combustion-related 
toxicants. Here, we report changes in biomarkers of exposure (BoE) and 
biomarkers of potential harm (BoPH) in smokers who completely switched to Vuse 
Vibe and Vuse Ciro ENDS products, or to smoking abstinence in a randomized, 
controlled clinical study. Thirteen BoE (12 urinary and one blood) that indicate 
exposure to harmful and potentially harmful toxicants (HPHCs) were evaluated at 
baseline on day 5. Urinary BoPH linked to oxidative stress, platelet activation, 
and inflammation were also assessed at baseline, and on day 5 and day 7. 
Nicotine exposure was lower in Vuse Vibe and Vuse Ciro groups compared to 
baseline values. Urinary non-nicotine BoE decreased significantly (52.3-96.7%) 
in the Vuse ENDS groups, and the reductions were similar in magnitude to those 
observed in the abstinence group. Blood carboxyhemoglobin decreased 52.8-55.0% 
in all study groups. Decreases (10-50%) in BoPH were observed in all study 
groups. Thus, smokers who switch exclusively to Vuse Vibe or Vuse Ciro products 
or completely abstain from smoking are exposed to substantially lower levels of 
HPHCs, and experience improvements in BoPH of oxidative stress and inflammation 
pathways.

NETs serve to ensnare and kill microbial pathogens. However, NETs can at the 
same time contribute to tissue damage and excessive inflammation. Nicotine is a 
major toxic agent and has been associated with exacerbated inflammatory 
diseases. The current study aimed at investigating the role of nicotine, the 
addictive component of tobacco and electronic cigarettes, on triggering NET 
formation. We report that nicotine induces neutrophils to release NETs in a 
dose-dependent manner. Nicotine-induced NET formation is mediated via nicotine 
acetylcholine receptors, depends on Akt and PAD4 activation, but is 
Nox2-independent, as demonstrated by pharmacological inhibition of Nox2 and by 
use of Nox2-deficient mouse neutrophils. These findings demonstrate that 
nicotine induces NETs, which may in turn contribute to smoking-related diseases.

BACKGROUND: Heated tobacco products (HTPs) were designed to deliver nicotine by 
heating the tobacco instead of burning it. This study aimed to examine the acute 
health effects on the respiratory and cardiovascular systems during the use of 
HTPs and compare these effects with acute health effects evoked by cigarette 
smoking or electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes).
METHODS: The study group comprised 160 healthy young adults (age 23 years; 
quartile 1 (Q1) 21 years; quartile 3 (Q3) 26 years) with both sexes divided into 
groups according to their smoking status: 40 HTP users (H group), 40 traditional 
cigarette smokers (T group), 40 e-cigarette users (E group) and 40 non-smokers 
(C group). Heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, exhaled nitric oxide 
fraction (FENO), carbon monoxide concentration, temperature of exhaled air and 
spirometry were measured three times: initially, immediately after the exposure, 
and after 30 min. The exposure differed depending on smoking status: heating 
HTP, smoking a cigarette, using an e-cigarette and simulation of smoking.
RESULTS: After 5 min of exposure, a significant decrease in FENO was observed in 
the H and E groups, from 12.8±5.5 ppb to 11.2±5.3 ppb in the H group and from 
16.9±6.5 ppb to 14.2±6.8 ppb in the E group (p<0.01). A slight but statistically 
significant increase in the temperature of exhaled air after 30 min was observed 
in groups T and E, from 34.1°C (Q1 33.6°C; Q3 34.4°C) to 34.4°C (Q1 34.1°C; Q3 
34.6°C) (p=0.02) in the T group and from 34.2°C (Q1 33.9°C; Q3 34.5°C) to 34.4°C 
(Q1 33.8°C; Q3 34.6°C) (p<0.01) in the E group. A significant increase in heart 
rate and blood pressure was observed in the T, E and H groups. Only cigarette 
smoking increased carbon monoxide levels (p<0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: The use of HTPs elicits acute respiratory and cardiovascular health 
effects.

BACKGROUND: Electronic "cigarettes" are marketed to tobacco users as potential 
reduced exposure products (PREP), albeit with little information regarding 
electronic cigarette user toxicant exposure and effects. This information may be 
obtained by adapting clinical laboratory methods used to evaluate other PREPs 
for smokers.
METHODS: Thirty-two smokers participated in four independent Latin-square 
ordered conditions that differed by product: own brand cigarette, "NPRO" 
electronic cigarettes (NPRO EC; 18 mg cartridge), "Hydro" electronic cigarettes 
(Hydro EC; 16 mg cartridge), or sham (unlit cigarette). Participants took 10 
puffs at two separate times during each session. Plasma nicotine and carbon 
monoxide (CO) concentration, heart rate, and subjective effects were assessed.
RESULTS: Own brand significantly increased plasma nicotine and CO concentration 
and heart rate within the first five minutes of administration whereas NPRO EC, 
Hydro EC, and sham smoking did not. Own brand, NPRO EC, and Hydro EC (but not 
sham) significantly decreased tobacco abstinence symptom ratings and increased 
product acceptability ratings. The magnitude of symptom suppression and 
increased acceptability was greater for own brand than for NPRO EC and Hydro EC.
CONCLUSIONS: Under these acute testing conditions, neither of the electronic 
cigarettes exposed users to measurable levels of nicotine or CO, although both 
suppressed nicotine/tobacco abstinence symptom ratings.
IMPACT: This study illustrates how clinical laboratory methods can be used to 
understand the acute effects of these and other PREPs for tobacco users. The 
results and methods reported here will likely be relevant to the evaluation and 
empirically based regulation of electronic cigarettes and similar products.

INTRODUCTION: In 2018, the US Surgeon General declared youth electronic nicotine 
delivery systems (ENDS) use as an epidemic. Combustible cigarettes have been 
shown to adversely affect folate status; however, no study to date has explored 
how ENDS impact folate status.
METHODS: In this case study, a white 18-year-old woman was followed for a 
1-month period as part of a larger study. During her participation in the study, 
a self-report of dietary folate consumption and use of alcohol, tobacco, and 
other drugs (ATOD) was collected. Each week, dried blood spots were collected to 
assess red blood cell (RBC) and serum folate.
RESULTS: During the first 2 weeks of the study, she used ENDS and her serum 
folate values were depleted in the ranges of 1.91 to 4.39 µg/L. During the third 
week, when no ENDS were used, her serum folate value was measured at 29.44 µg/L. 
When ENDS use resumed during the fourth week, her serum folate value fell to 
7.50 µg/L.
CONCLUSIONS: This relationship suggests the need for additional studies on ENDS 
use and serum folate status, particularly among adolescent women who already 
have the lowest folate status nationally.

Cigarette smoke is an aerosol containing microparticles that carry nicotine into 
the lung alveolar region where nicotine is rapidly absorbed into circulation. 
Nicotine exposure in smokers is a chronic intermittent process, with episodic 
intake during wakefulness and abstinence during sleep resulting in circadian 
fluctuation of blood nicotine levels. We developed an integrated platform where 
freely moving rodents can be exposed to episodic nicotine aerosol on an 
investigator-designed schedule. Plasma nicotine and its metabolite cotinine 
levels were determined with a LC-MS/MS method. We characterized the aerosol in 
the breathing zone of the rodent exposure chamber. The droplet-size distribution 
was within the respirable diameter range. The system can generate a wide range 
of nicotine concentrations in air that meet a variety of experimental needs. 
Rats were exposed to nicotine aerosol once every half hour in the dark phase of 
12:12-h light-dark cycles for 10 days. We optimized the parameters of aerosol 
generation and exposure: plasma nicotine and cotinine concentrations reached 
30-35 and 190-240 ng/ml, respectively. The nicotine levels and circadian 
patterns resembled the pharmacokinetic pattern of human smokers. In summary, we 
developed an aerosol system that can produce clinically relevant chronic 
intermittent nicotine exposure in unanesthetized, unrestrained rodents with 
route of administration and circadian blood pharmacokinetics resembling human 
smokers. This methodology is a novel tool for understanding the health effects 
of chronic intermittent nicotine exposure such as with tobacco cigarettes and 
electronic cigarettes for studies of behavior, pharmacology and toxicology, 
nicotine addiction, tobacco-related diseases, and teratogenicity, and for the 
discovery of therapeutics. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We developed a lung alveolar 
region-targeted aerosol method and a system that provides chronic intermittent 
nicotine exposure in freely moving rodents. The method produces in rodents 
clinically relevant nicotine exposure with the route and circadian 
pharmacokinetics resembling human smokers. This method is a novel tool for 
understanding the health impacts of chronic nicotine exposures such as with 
tobacco cigarettes and electronic cigarettes, for studying nicotine 
pharmacology, toxicology, addiction, and tobacco-related diseases, and for the

Background: The widespread use of the JUUL™ device ignited a discussion about 
the effects these products have on harm reduction. Therefore, we conducted a 
study directly comparing the JUUL™ device with a cigarette, a heated tobacco 
product, and a nicotine-free e-cigarette to examine the acute effects on 
arterial stiffness. Methods: This crossover-designed study examines 20 
occasional smokers (age 25.2 ± 2.5 years). Study participants used each of the 
four smoking devices for a duration of 5 min following a protocol. Peripheral 
blood pressure and parameters of arterial stiffness and endothelial vasodilator 
function such as the reactive hyperemia index and the augmentation index were 
measured using the EndoPAT™2000 before and after. Results: In addition to 
significant peripheral hemodynamic changes after 5 and 10 min (p < 0.05), the 
reactive hyperemia index showed a significant decrease for all devices 15 min 
after consumption and remained significantly decreased after 60 min (p < 0.01). 
The augmentation index adjusted for a heart rate of 75 bpm increased 
significantly for all devices 15 and 60 min after consumption (p < 0.01). 
Conclusions: In conclusion, the increases in blood pressure and arterial 
stiffness are similar after smoking, JUUL™ing, heating, and vaping. These 
changes may be associated with an increase in cardiovascular risks; however, an 
evaluation of the long-term effects of JUUL™ing, vaping and heating is needed.

BACKGROUND: Through measurements of the heart rate variability (HRV) accompanied 
by the pertinent biomarker assays, the effects of nicotine and byproducts 
derived from alternative nicotine delivery systems (ANDS) on the autonomic 
nervous system (ANS) and hormonal system have been investigated.
METHODS: HRV was studied in a group of volunteers (17 people), involving 
non-smokers, i.e., who never smoked before (11), ex-smokers (4) and active 
smokers (2). ANDS and smoking simulators, including regular, nicotine-free and 
electronic cigarettes; tobacco heating systems; chewing gums and nicotine packs 
of oral fixation (nic-packs), were used. Blood pressure, levels of stress 
hormones in saliva and catecholamines in the blood were also monitored.
RESULTS: HRV analysis showed relatively small changes in HRV and in the other 
studied parameters with the systemic use of nic-packs with low and moderate 
nicotine contents (up to 6 mg) compared to other ANDS.
CONCLUSIONS: The HRV method is proven to be a promising technique for evaluation 
of the risks associated with smoking, dual use of various ANDS and studying the 
biomedical aspects of smoking cessation. Nic-packs are shown to be leaders in 
biological safety among the studied ANDS. A sharp surge in the activity of the 
sympathetic division of the ANS within the first minutes of the use of nicotine 
packs implies that nicotine begins to act already at very low doses (before 
entering the blood physically in any significant amount) through fast signal 
transmission to the brain from the nicotinic and taste buds located in the mouth 
area.

With the growing number of individuals regularly using e-cigarettes, it has 
become increasingly important to understand the psychobiological effects of 
nicotine salts. Nicotine increases the release of dopamine (DA) into the nucleus 
accumbens (NAc), causing feelings of satisfaction. However, the differences in 
the DA-increasing effects of different nicotine salts have not been reported. In 
this study, we used a G protein-coupled receptor-activated DA fluorescent probe 
(GRABDA1m) and optical fiber photometric recording equipment to monitor the 
dynamic changes and kinetics of DA release in the NAc of mice exposed to 
different e-cigarette aerosols, including nicotine, nicotine benzoate, nicotine 
tartrate, nicotine lactate, nicotine levulinic acid, nicotine malate, and 
nicotine citrate. The results of this study were as follows: 1) Different types 
of nicotine salts could increase the release of DA in the NAc. 2) The slopes and 
half-effective concentrations of the fitted curves were different, suggesting 
that each nicotine salt had a difference in the efficiency of increasing DA 
release with concentration changes. 3) The absorption rates of different 
nicotine salts containing the same original nicotine concentration were 
significantly different by measuring the blood nicotine content. The effect of 
nicotine salts on increasing DA was directly proportional to the blood nicotine 
level. In conclusion, by observing the effects of nicotine salts on DA release 
in real time in vivo, differences in the pharmacological effects of nicotine 
salts are revealed to better understand the mechanism underlying the regulatory 
effects of nicotine salts on the brain.

Potentially reduced exposure products (PREPs), already sold in USA and in some 
European Countries, are low-nitrosamine cigarettes, low-nitrosamine smokeless 
tobacco (e.g., the Swedish Snus), cigarette-like products, and medicinal 
nicotine products. Even e-cigarette delivers nicotine. With the exception of 
snus and medicinal nicotine, studies on the health effects of PREPs have not 
been carried out, although some PREPs are already sold and promoted as products 
that effectively reduce health risks. Thus, a second disaster similar to that 
occurred for light cigarettes could happen in the next years. Only medicinal 
nicotine and snus could be valid candidates to become PREPs, even if they pose 
some significant health risks. The World Health Organization, following a 
precautionary approach, has recently published a list of 9 carcinogens or 
toxicants recommended for mandated lowering (the tobacco-specific nitrosamines 
NNN and NNK, acetaldehyde, acrolein, benzene, benzo[a]pyrene, 1-3 butadiene, 
carbon monoxide, formaldehyde), and 9 carcinogens or toxicants for monitoring in 
usual cigarettes (not PREPs), underlining that tobacco companies cannot use this 
reduction strategy as a promotional message, as it occurred for light cigarettes 
in the 70s and 80s. The present status quo, in which cigarettes are freely 
available, medicinal nicotine, being a drug, is available under a regulated 
market, and Snus is prohibited, actually denies smokers the right to choose 
safer nicotine products. The solution suggested by the UK Royal College of 
Physicians is to balance the nicotine market, framing tobacco products and 
medicinal nicotine in the same regulation system; establishing a nicotine and 
tobacco regulatory authority;making medicinal nicotine more available; 
evaluating the feasibility of the introduction in the English market of Swedish 
Snus. California Government remarks that the nicotine maintenance is not a valid 
strategy, because it could induce smokers not to try to quit.Thus, California 
Department of Health Services prohibits promotion of snus and medicinal nicotine 
as a harm reduction strategy. However, the US Federal Family Smoking Prevention 
and Tobacco Control Act, signed by President Obama in 2009, places tobacco 
products under FDA jurisdiction: FDA must define criteria for lowering 
carcinogens and toxicants in tobacco products, making more available medicinal 
nicotine, evaluating PREPs, creating a federal Tobacco Control Agency.Which 
approaches is Italy going to follow?

Smoking cessation is difficult but maintaining smoke-free without nicotine 
replacement therapy is even harder. During the last few years, several different 
alternative products, including heated tobacco products (HTP), have been 
introduced to the market. In this study, we investigated the acute effects of 
IQOSTM and gloTM (two HTP) consumption on small airway function and arterial 
stiffness in a head-to-head design, comparing them to combustible cigarettes, 
nicotine-free e-cigarettes and a sham smoking group. Seventeen healthy 
occasional smokers were included in a single-center, five-arm, crossover study. 
The parameters of small airway function and hemodynamics were collected at 
several time points before and after consumption using Mobil-O-Graph™ (I.E.M., 
Stolberg, Germany) and TremoFlo® c-100 (THORASYS Thoracic Medical Systems Inc., 
Montreal, QC, Canada). Small airway obstruction and resistance were both 
significantly increased after the consumption of cigarettes and substitute 
products. All products containing nicotine led to similar significant increases 
in blood pressure and arterial stiffness. Hemodynamic parameters were also 
increased after the consumption of e-cigarettes without nicotine, but compared 
to nicotine-containing products, the increase was shorter and weaker. We 
conclude that, although it has yet to be determined why, HTP have acute harmful 
effects on small airway function, possibly even exceeding the effects of 
combustible cigarettes. Like other nicotine-containing products, HTP leads to a 
nicotine-related acute increase in arterial stiffness and cardiovascular stress, 
similar to combustible cigarettes, which associates these products with an 
increased cardiovascular risk.

Vaping involves the use of a device to deliver aerosolized nicotine and 
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) oils to the lungs. Vaping continues to increase in 
popularity; however, because it is a novel drug delivery system there is little 
evidence regarding its safety and long-term consequences. Here, we present a 
22-year-old Caucasian male who was admitted with acute hypoxic respiratory 
failure and massive hemoptysis. Contrasted computed tomography of the chest 
demonstrated ground glass opacities throughout all lung fields and bilateral 
pulmonary emboli. Bronchoalveolar lavage revealed increased red blood cell 
counts in serial aliquots, consistent with the diagnosis of diffuse alveolar 
hemorrhage (DAH). An extensive workup did not reveal an etiology for the DAH. 
However, further history was obtained, and the patient divulged daily vaping of 
THC. E-cigarette, or vaping, product use associated lung injury (EVALI) consists 
of a myriad of different lung injury patterns. Our case illustrates an uncommon 
presentation of EVALI with DAH and multiple pulmonary emboli.

Richmond, VA 23298, USA.

AIMS:   To provide an initial abuse liability assessment of an electronic 
cigarette (EC) in current tobacco cigarette smokers.
DESIGN:   The first of four within-subject sessions was an EC sampling session 
that involved six, 10-puff bouts (30 seconds inter-puff interval), each bout 
separated by 30 minutes. In the remaining three sessions participants made 
choices between 10 EC puffs and varying amounts of money, 10 EC puffs and a 
varying number of own brand cigarette (OB) puffs, or 10 OB puffs and varying 
amounts of money using the multiple-choice procedure (MCP). The MCP was 
completed six times at 30-minute intervals, and one choice was reinforced 
randomly at each trial.
SETTING:   Clinical laboratory.
PARTICIPANTS:   Twenty current tobacco cigarette smokers.
MEASUREMENTS:   Sampling session outcome measures included plasma nicotine, 
cardiovascular response and subjective effects. Choice session outcome was the 
cross-over value on the MCP.
FINDINGS:   EC use resulted in significant nicotine delivery, tobacco abstinence 
symptom suppression and increased product acceptability ratings. On the MCP, 
participants chose to receive 10 EC puffs over an average of $1.06 or three OB 
puffs and chose 10 OB puffs over an average of $1.50 (P < 0.003).
CONCLUSIONS:   Electronic cigarettes can deliver clinically significant amounts 
of nicotine and reduce cigarette abstinence symptoms and appear to have lower 
potential for abuse relative to traditional tobacco cigarettes, at least under 
certain laboratory conditions.

BACKGROUND: Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus associated with the 
coronavirus disease (COVID-19) causing a pandemic worldwide in 2020. There are 
other noninfectious diseases that can present exactly as COVID-19, and the 
management and approach are completely different, hence the importance of 
understanding and having a wide differential in patients presenting with similar 
characteristics. Case Report. A 23-year-old male, with a history of childhood 
asthma, presented to the Emergency Department in a hospital in south Florida in 
the USA with complaints of a 2-day duration of subjective fever, chills, dry 
cough, dyspnea, and myalgia. His vital signs were blood pressure 135/65 mmHg, 
temperature 39°C, pulse 134 bpm, respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and 
saturation of oxygen 96% in room air. Laboratory analysis was significant for 
white blood cells 15.3 × 103/μL, ALT 69 U/L, AST 66 U/L, ferritin 375.6 ng/mL, 
C-reactive protein 27.70 mg/dL, and procalcitonin 1.43 ng/mL. A respiratory 
pathogen panel (RPP) and a SARS-CoV-2 test were both negative. The patient was 
given empiric antibiotic treatment and hydroxychloroquine. Two more tests for 
SARS-CoV-2 were negative, and the patient reported that he smoked marijuana 
through an e-cigarette. The patient was started on high-dose steroids, and 
symptoms improved.
CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is an emergent lung disease that is affecting the 
population worldwide; many other noninfectious diseases can mimic its 
presentations and laboratory characteristics; the importance of having a broad 
differential diagnosis especially in causing confusion during pandemic times is 
valuable in the management of patients with such presentations, such as EVALI, 
and glucocorticoids will be indicated in this circumstances.

Birth?

Hematopoiesis is a tightly regulated process orchestrated by cell-intrinsic and 
cell-extrinsic cues. Over the past several decades, much effort has been focused 
on understanding how these cues regulate hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function. 
Many endogenous key regulators of hematopoiesis have been identified and 
extensively characterized. Less is known about the mechanisms of long-term 
effects of environmental toxic compounds on hematopoietic stem and progenitor 
cells (HSPCs) and their mature immune cell progeny. Research over the past 
several decades has demonstrated that tobacco products are extremely toxic and 
pose huge risks to human health by causing diseases like cancer, respiratory 
illnesses, strokes, and more. Recently, electronic cigarettes have been promoted 
as a safer alternative to traditional tobacco products and have become 
increasingly popular among younger generations. Nicotine, the highly toxic 
compound found in many traditional tobacco products, is also found in most 
electronic cigarettes, calling into question their purported "safety". Although 
it is known that nicotine is toxic, the pathophysiology of disease in exposed 
people remains under investigation. One plausible contributor to altered disease 
susceptibility is altered hematopoiesis and associated immune dysfunction. In 
this review, we focus on research that has addressed how HSCs and mature blood 
cells respond to nicotine, as well as identify remaining questions.

The disruption of glucose homeostasis associated with the use of nicotine 
delivery systems may be due to a shift to lipid metabolism. Indirect calorimetry 
was used to measure the respiratory exchange ratio (RER) in female (N = 21) and 
male (N = 21) C57BL/6J mice exposed to room air (control) or e-cigarette vapor 
in a 1L chamber to test the hypothesis that lipid metabolism predominates in 
vaped mice. Metabolism was quantified via RER using a GA-200 gas analyzer 
(iWorx, Inc) and LabScribe v.4 (iWorx, Inc.) software. Blood glucose levels were 
assessed from a subset of the population using an Accu-Check glucometer (Roche 
Diagnostics, Inc.). Statistical analyses were conducted using R v.4.0.3. Median 
RER for controls was lower in females. Older females showed a reduction in RER 
when exposure occurred in the afternoon (p < 0.001), and in males when exposure 
occurred in the morning (p = 0.007). Glucose concentrations (mg/dL) were higher 
after e-cigarette inhalation compared with controls, but this difference was not 
significant (p = 0.464). The reduction in the respiratory exchange ratio 
supports the hypothesis that e-cigarette inhalation promotes lipid metabolism, 
and the magnitude of the effect is influenced by gender, age and time of day.

Smoking has long been implicated in the development and progression of numerous 
postoperative complications. The cause is largely thought to be the presence of 
reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cigarette smoke, which attenuates inflammation 
and affects neutrophil function. Wound healing is further compromised by 
deficiencies in vitamins C and E, which result from a higher vitamin turnover 
secondary to the oxidative stress produced by smoking. However, studies recently 
have found that the effects of nicotine may benefit healing if used in 
isolation. We summarise the effects that smoking and abstaining from smoking can 
have on inflammation and wound healing, and describe the possible benefits that 
nicotine replacement and antioxidant supplements can give.

Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are becoming increasingly popular worldwide 
and their cellular effects warrant further evaluation. In this study, we 
investigated the effects of an e-cigarette cartridge solution on allergen 
related asthmatic airway inflammation (AI) and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), 
when it is delivered by intratracheal route in mice. Asthmatic AI and AHR were 
induced by systemic sensitization to ovalbumin (OVA) followed by intratracheal, 
intraperitoneal, and aerosol allergen challenges in BALB/c mice. The cartridge 
solution of e-cigarette (containing 16 mg/ml nicotine) was diluted 50 times and 
100 μl of the diluted solution was intratracheally instilled to OVA-sensitized 
(OVA-S) mice two times a week for 10 weeks. Long-term e-cigarette inhalation 
elicited no remarkable changes in the activities of alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase enzymes in serum, 
however, increased infiltration of inflammatory cells including eosinophils, 
into airways from blood, aggravated the asthmatic AI and AHR, and stimulated the 
production of cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5 and IL-13, and 
OVA-specific IgE production. Our data suggest that the inhalation of e-cigarette 
solutions can function as an important factor to exacerbate the allergy-induced 
asthma symptoms. Further studies are needed to address the effects of 
e-cigarette solutions on human health.

Tobacco use is a major modifiable risk factor for adverse health outcomes, 
including cancer, and elicits profound epigenetic changes thought to be 
associated with long-term cancer risk. While electronic cigarettes 
(e-cigarettes) have been advocated as harm reduction alternatives to tobacco 
products, recent studies have revealed potential detrimental effects, 
highlighting the urgent need for further research into the molecular and health 
impacts of e-cigarettes. Here, we applied computational deconvolution methods to 
dissect the cell- and tissue-specific epigenetic effects of tobacco or 
e-cigarette use on DNA methylation (DNAme) in over 3,500 buccal/saliva, 
cervical, or blood samples, spanning epithelial and immune cells at directly and 
indirectly exposed sites. The 535 identified smoking-related DNAme loci (CpGs) 
clustered into four functional groups, including detoxification or growth 
signaling, based on cell type and anatomical site. Loci hypermethylated in 
buccal epithelial cells of smokers associated with NOTCH1/RUNX3/growth factor 
receptor signaling also exhibited elevated methylation in cancer tissue and 
progressing lung carcinoma in situ lesions, and hypermethylation of these sites 
predicted lung cancer development in buccal samples collected from smokers up to 
22 years prior to diagnosis, suggesting a potential role in driving 
carcinogenesis. Alarmingly, these CpGs were also hypermethylated in e-cigarette 
users with a limited smoking history. This study sheds light on the cell 
type-specific changes to the epigenetic landscape induced by smoking-related 
products.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Although e-cigarettes have become popular, especially among 
youth, the health effects associated with e-cigarette use remain unclear. This 
review discusses current evidence relating to the cardiovascular, pulmonary, and 
immunological effects of e-cigarettes.
RECENT FINDINGS: The use of e-cigarettes by healthy adults has been shown to 
increase blood pressure, heart rate, and arterial stiffness, as well as 
resistance to air flow in lungs. Inhalation of e-cigarette aerosol has been 
shown to elicit immune responses and increase the production of immunomodulatory 
cytokines in young tobacco-naïve individuals. In animal models, long-term 
exposure to e-cigarettes leads to marked changes in lung architecture, 
dysregulation of immune genes, and low-grade inflammation. Exposure to 
e-cigarette aerosols in mice has been shown to induce DNA damage, inhibit DNA 
repair, and promote carcinogenesis. Chronic exposure to e-cigarettes has also 
been reported to result in the accumulation of lipid-laden macrophages in the 
lung and dysregulation of lipid metabolism and transport in mice. Although, the 
genotoxic and inflammatory effects of e-cigarettes are milder than those of 
combustible cigarettes, some of the cardiorespiratory effects of the two insults 
are comparable. The toxicity of e-cigarettes has been variably linked to 
nicotine, as well as other e-cigarette constituents, operating conditions, and 
use patterns.
SUMMARY: The use of e-cigarettes in humans is associated with significant 
adverse cardiorespiratory and immunological changes. Data from animal models and 
in vitro studies support the notion that long-term use of e-cigarettes may pose 
significant health risks.

BACKGROUND: Peripheral arterial disease affects the lower limb and is associated 
with diabetes, high cholesterol, smoking and obesity. It increases the risk of 
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. It can be symptomatic causing 
intermittent claudication, but often there are few clinical signs. Podiatrists 
are able to detect the presence of peripheral arterial disease as part of their 
lower limb assessment and are well placed to give advice on lifestyle changes to 
help reduce disease progression. This is important to improve health outcomes 
and is offered as a prevention/public health intervention.
METHOD: We describe the clinical and patient-centred outcomes of patients 
attending a podiatry-led integrated care pathway in a multi-use clinic situated 
in a venue supported by the National Centre for Sports and Exercise Medicine in 
the UK. At the baseline appointment, patients were given a full assessment where 
symptoms of intermittent claudication using the Edinburgh Intermittent 
Claudication Questionnaire, foot pulses, Doppler sounds, Ankle Brachial Pressure 
Indices, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and cholesterol levels, and smoking status 
were recorded. A tailored treatment plan was devised, including referral to an 
exercise referral service, smoking cessation programmes (if applicable) and each 
participant was also seen by a dietician for nutritional advice. Participants 
were followed up at 3 and 6 months to assess any improvement in vascular status 
and with each completing the EQ-5D quality of life questionnaire and a simple 
satisfaction questionnaire at the end of the study. As this was a complex 
intervention a pilot study design was adopted to evaluate if the method and 
outcomes were suitable and acceptable to participants the results of which will 
then inform the design of a larger study.
RESULTS: Data was collected on 21 individuals; 15 men (71.4%) and 6 women 
(28.6%) across the 6-month study period. Eleven participants were referred onto 
the exercise referral service; 16 participants saw the dietician for nutritional 
advice at baseline and had one-to-one or telephone follow-up at 3 months. Five 
out of 14 participants had reduced scores from baseline of intermittent 
claudication during the study period. No evidence for substantive changes in 
Doppler sounds or ABPI measurements was revealed. Quality of life scores with 
the EQ-5D improved in 15 participants; this was statistically significant 
(p = 0.007) with 14 participants who completed the simple satisfaction 
questionnaire expressing a positive view of the programme. Of the four people 
who were smokers, two stopped smoking cigarettes and moved to e-cigarettes as 
part of smoking cessation advice.
CONCLUSION: As this was a pilot study the sample size was low, but some 
statistically significant improvements with some measures were observed over the 
6-month study. Podiatrists are able to provide a comprehensive vascular 
assessment of the lower limb and accompanying tailored advice on lifestyle 
changes including smoking cessation and exercise. Locating clinics in National 
Centres for Sports and Exercise Medicine enables easy access to exercise 
facilities to encourage the adoption of increased activity levels, though the 
long term sustainability of exercise programmes still requires evaluation.This

Tobacco smoking increases the risk of metabolic disorders due to the combination 
of harmful chemicals, whereas pure nicotine can improve glucose tolerance. 
E-cigarette vapour contains nicotine and some of the harmful chemicals found in 
cigarette smoke at lower levels. To investigate how e-vapour affects metabolic 
profiles, male Balb/c mice were exposed to a high-fat diet (HFD, 43% fat, 
20kJ/g) for 16weeks, and e-vapour in the last 6weeks. HFD alone doubled fat mass 
and caused dyslipidaemia and glucose intolerance. E-vapour reduced fat mass in 
HFD-fed mice; only nicotine-containing e-vapour improved glucose tolerance. In 
chow-fed mice, e-vapour increased lipid content in both blood and liver. Changes 
in liver metabolic markers may be adaptive responses rather than causal. Future 
studies can investigate how e-vapour differentially affects metabolic profiles 
with different diets.

[Chronic diseases: recent trends, challenges and prospects for change].

[Article in French]

Vernay M, Bonaldi C, Grémy I.

INTRODUCTION: The objectives were to describe available sources for 
epidemiological surveillance of chronic diseases, recent trends, and underlying 
phenomena for these changes and to deduce possible scenarios for the future.
METHODS: Based on the examples of coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes, 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer, the authors 
describe recent trends in mortality and hospitalizations in the general 
population.
RESULTS: Exceptfor diabetes, the morbidity and mortality of the diseases 
considered have globally declined over the last decade. However, trends varied 
according to age and gender and an increase in mortality from myocardial 
infarction, COPD and lung cancer was observed among women under the age of 55. 
Overall, decreased morbidity and mortality can be explained by improvements in 
primary prevention (blood pressure, cholesterol, smoking among men...) and 
prevention of recurrences and complications.
DISCUSSION: It is unclear whether these improvements will continue in the 
future. Aging, obesity, diabetes and smoking among women should negatively 
impact the medium-term morbidity and life expectancy (especially disability-free 
life expectancy). It is still difficult to predict future trends, as other 
factors could attenuate (electronic cigarettes, bariatric surgery...) or, on the 
contrary exacerbate (increased social inequalities in times of economic crisis, 
continued increase in smoking among women, diabetes...) these trends.

Nicotine and cannabis are two of the most commonly consumed licit and illicit 
drugs during pregnancy, often consumed together via e-cigarettes. Vaping is 
assumed to be a safer alternative than traditional routes of consumption, yet 
the potential consequences of prenatal e-cigarette exposure are largely unknown, 
particularly when these two drugs are co-consumed. In a novel co-exposure model, 
pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats received nicotine (36 mg/mL), tetrahydrocannabinol 
(THC) (100 mg/mL), the combination, or the vehicle via e-cigarettes daily from 
gestational days 5-20, mimicking the first and second human trimesters. Maternal 
blood samples were collected throughout pregnancy to measure drug and metabolite 
levels, and core body temperatures before and after exposure were also measured. 
Pregnant dams exposed to combined nicotine and THC had lower plasma nicotine and 
cotinine levels than those exposed to nicotine alone; similarly, the combined 
exposure group also had lower plasma THC and THC metabolite (THC-OH and 
THC-COOH) levels than those exposed to THC alone. Prenatal nicotine exposure 
gradually decreased initial core body temperatures each day, with chronic 
exposure, whereas exposure to THC decreased temperatures during the individual 
sessions. Despite these physiological effects, no changes were observed in food 
or water intake, weight gain, or basic litter outcomes. The use of this model 
can help elucidate the effects of co-exposure to THC and nicotine via 
e-cigarettes on both users and their offspring. Understanding the effects of 
co-use during pregnancy is critical for improving education for pregnant mothers 
about prenatal e-cigarette use and has important implications for public policy.

Electronic-cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are devices designed to become an 
alternative to classic cigarettes. Vaping of e-cigarettes and their recharge 
liquid have become extremely popular among the adolescents; however, its safety 
is not well established. Evaluation of the components of e-cigarette liquid and 
their potential effects on testis of adult male mice. This aim will be fulfilled 
by histological, ultrastructural, and immunohistochemical analysis of mice 
testis biopsies. Twenty mice were allocated into two groups of equal size. The 
control group was given regular saline, whereas the treated group was given 
e-liquid (contains 3 mg of nicotine/kg of body weight) both groups daily 
intraperitoneally injected for 3 weeks. Analysis of e-liquid by Gas 
Chromatography-Mass Spectrometric GC/MS demonstrated nicotine, phenol, vanillin, 
aldehydes, and pyrethroid insecticide. Evaluation of oxidative stress parameters 
revealed significant reduction of SOD and GPx. Histological results revealed a 
significant reduction in the height of seminiferous tubules, sloughing of 
spermatogenic cells, most cells being dark and pyknotic, and thickening of the 
interstitium with accumulation of PAS positive exudate. Most spermatogenic cells 
showed degenerative changes as rarefied cytoplasm, ill-defined electron-dense 
nuclei, and elongated spermatid showed deformity of ectoplasmic specialization. 
Immunohistochemical studies revealed a significant increase in caspase-3 
positive cells and a significant reduction of area % of E-cadherin. The analysis 
of an available E-liquid demonstrated potentially harmful chemicals that are not 
shown in the labeling of the product. E-liquid appears to impair anti-oxidant 
defense and cause degenerative changes in the body and disruption of blood 
testes barrier BTB. So, e-cigarettes cannot be regarded as a non-harmful smoking 
replacement.

Chronic idiopathic neutrophilia in a smoker, relieved after smoking cessation 
with the use of electronic cigarette: a case report.

INTRODUCTION: Smoking is a major risk factor for a variety of diseases. 
Electronic cigarettes are battery-operated devices that deliver nicotine to the 
lungs by evaporation of a liquid. Chronic idiopathic neutrophilia is a condition 
characterized by elevated white blood cell and neutrophil counts without any 
underlying disease; smoking has been implicated as a potential cause.
CASE PRESENTATION: A male Caucasian patient, born in 1977, presented in 
September 2005 with asymptomatic elevation of white blood cell and neutrophil 
count, and mildly-elevated C-reactive protein levels. He was a smoker since 1996 
and was treated with 20 mg/day of simvastatin since 2003 due to hyperlipidemia. 
Clinical examination, and laboratory and imaging investigations ruled out any 
infectious, haematological, rheumatological, or endocrine conditions. He was 
followed-up regularly and was advised to stop smoking. He had 2 unsuccessful 
attempts to quit smoking; one was unassisted and the second was performed with 
the use of both varenicline and nicotine replacement therapy (patches). During 
the subsequent 6.5 years, his leukocyte and C-reactive protein levels were 
repeatedly elevated; the condition was consistent with chronic idiopathic 
neutrophilia. In February 2012, he started using electronic cigarettes and he 
managed to quit smoking within 10 days. After 6 months, laboratory examination 
showed normalized leukocyte count and C-reactive protein levels, confirmed 
immediately by a second laboratory and by repeated tests after 1 and 2 months.
CONCLUSION: Smoking cessation with the use of electronic cigarette led to 
reversal of chronic idiopathic neutrophilia. The daily use of electronic 
cigarette may help preserve the beneficial effects of smoking cessation.

Richmond, VA 23298, USA.

INTRODUCTION: Electronic cigarettes (ECs) are marketed as nicotine delivery 
devices. Two studies with EC-naïve participants suggest that ECs deliver little 
or no nicotine. In those studies, standard-sized ECs were used, though 
experienced EC users often use larger devices that house higher voltage and/or 
longer lasting batteries. Whether user experience and device characteristics 
influence EC nicotine delivery is uncertain. The purpose of the present study 
was to examine the effects of ECs in experienced users who were using their 
preferred devices.
METHODS: Eight EC users (3 women) who had been using ECs for at least 3 months, 
completed one 5-hr session using devices they provided and the flavor/strength 
nicotine cartridges they selected. Sessions consisted of 4 phases: baseline, 10 
puffs (30-s interpuff interval) from the device, 1-hr ad lib puffing period, and 
a 2-hr rest period (no puffing). Outcome measures in each phase included plasma 
nicotine concentration, heart rate, and subjective ratings of nicotine/product 
effects and abstinence symptoms.
RESULTS: Relative to baseline, plasma nicotine and heart rate increased 
significantly within 5 min of the first puff and remained elevated throughout 
the ad lib puffing period. Increases in ratings of direct effects of nicotine 
and product were observed as well as decreases in abstinence symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: User experience and/or device characteristics likely influence EC 
nicotine delivery and other effects. Systematic manipulation of these and other 
variables could elucidate conditions that produce intended effects.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of mortality in Croatia and 
in Europe. Primary prevention of CVD involves intervention before the onset of 
disease, and prevention of modifiable risk factors, i.e. cigarette smoking, 
hyperlipidemia, arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, inactivity, obesity. 
These risk factors are strongly associated and lead to impaired vascular 
endothelial function, chronic injury of endothelium, platelet activation and 
aggregation, atherosclerotic plaque formation, and in the end manifestation of 
CVD. The risk of any coronary event increases exponentially when two or more 
risk factors are present. Aside from conventional factors, it has been 
demonstrated that raised levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), cytokines, 
homocysteine and fibrinogen are also important promotors of the disease, 
pointing to partially inflammatory nature of coronary atherosclerosis. The 
effects of risk factors such as smoking, arterial hypertension and 
hyperlipidemia on vascular endothelium are proven to be reversible. According to 
Guidelines on Cardiovascular Disease Prevention in Clinical Practice of the 
European Society of Cardiology (2007), population is advised to follow the 
formula 0 3 5 140 5 3 0. It suggests that crucial measures in preserving 
cardiovascular health are as follows: no smoking (0), walking 3 km daily or 30 
minutes of any moderate activity (3), blood pressure less than 140 mm Hg 
systolic (140), total blood cholesterol less than 5 mmol/L (5), LDL cholesterol 
less than 3 mmol/L (3), avoidance of overweight and diabetes (0). There are many 
studies proving the beneficial effects of statins and ACE inhibitors in 
improving endothelial function and endorsing primary prevention.

Electronic cigarettes have become increasingly popular, but the results of 
previous studies on electronic cigarette exposure in animals have been 
equivocal. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of electronic cigarette 
smoke (ECS) and cigarette smoke (CS) on lung function and pulmonary inflammation 
in mice to investigate whether electronic cigarettes are safer when compared to 
cigarettes. 32 specific pathogen-free BALB/c male mice were randomly grouped and 
exposed to fresh air (control), mint-flavored ECS (ECS1, 6 mg/kg), 
cheese-flavored ECS (ECS2, 6 mg/kg), and CS (6 mg/kg). After 3 weeks exposure to 
ECS or CS, we measured lung function (PIF and Penh) and blood oxygen saturation. 
The levels of TNF-α and IL-6 in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and 
serum were measured using ELISA. HE staining was performed to observe the 
pathological changes in the lung tissues. The levels of IL-6 in BALF and serum, 
and TNF-α in BALF, were elevated similarly in the ECS and CS groups compared to 
the control group. Significant elevation was observed in serum TNF-α levels in 
the CS group. The total count of cells in BALF were increased after ECS1 
exposure and CS exposure. PIF and oxygen saturation decreased, and Penh 
increased markedly in the CS group but not in the ECS groups. Compared with the 
ECS groups, mice in the CS group had widened lung tissue septa and increased 
inflammatory cell infiltration. However, we did not detect significant 
differences between mint-flavored and cheese-flavored e-cigarettes in our study. 
Overall, our findings suggested that both ECS and CS impair lung function and 
histopathology while promoting inflammation. In contrast, ECS has a less 
negative impact than CS.

OBJECTIVES: Menthol is often added to cigarettes and e-cigarette solutions for 
its cooling and anti-irritant effects, and may contribute to development of 
nicotine dependence, particularly in vulnerable populations such as adolescents, 
and among African Americans. Menthol is rapidly metabolized to menthol 
glucuronide (MG) with little or no unconjugated menthol measurable in venous 
blood. Human challenge studies of the effects of inhaled menthol, and of its 
interactions with nicotine, would benefit from a quantitative measure of acute 
menthol exposure. Our objective was to determine whether plasma MG 
concentrations might be a suitable quantitative biomarker of acute menthol 
exposure following its inhalation.
METHODS: We performed a secondary analysis of plasma MG concentrations obtained 
during a study of the effects of inhaled menthol on behavioral responses to 
intravenous nicotine. MG concentrations were followed over time in venous plasma 
from 48 participants following inhalation of aerosols from e-cigarettes 
employing solutions containing either of 2 menthol concentrations or placebo.
RESULTS: Whereas plasma MG concentrations were variable, they showed a 
dose-dependent increase following menthol inhalation.
CONCLUSIONS: Measurement of plasma MG may be useful to assess inter-individual 
differences in acute menthol exposure in human challenge studies involving 
menthol inhalation.

Epigenomic-wide DNA methylation profiling holds the potential to reflect both 
electronic cigarette exposure-associated risks and individual poor health 
outcomes. However, a systemic study in animals or humans is still lacking. Using 
the Infinium Mouse Methylation BeadChip, we examined the DNA methylation status 
of white blood cells in male ApoE-/- mice after 14 weeks of electronic cigarette 
exposure with the InExpose system (2 hr/day, 5 days/week, 50% PG and 50% VG) 
with low (6 mg/ml) and high (36 mg/ml) nicotine concentrations. Our results 
indicate that electronic cigarette aerosol inhalation induces significant 
alteration of 8,985 CpGs in a dose-dependent manner (FDR<0.05); 7,389 (82.2%) of 
the CpG sites are annotated with known genes. Among the top 6 significant CpG 
sites (P-value<1e-8), 4 CpG sites are located in the known genes, and most (3/5) 
of these genes have been related to cigarette smoking. The other two CpGs are 
close to/associated with the Phc2 gene that was recently linked to smoking in a 
transcriptome-wide associations study. Furthermore, the gene set enrichment 
analysis highlights the activation of MAPK and 4 
cardiomyocyte/cardiomyopathy-related signaling pathways (including adrenergic 
signaling in cardiomyocytes and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy) 
following repeated electronic cigarette use. The MAPK pathway activation 
correlates well with our finding of increased cytokine mRNA expression after 
electronic cigarette exposure in the same batch of mice. Interestingly, two 
pathways related to mitochondrial activities, namely mitochondrial gene 
expression and mitochondrial translation, are also activated after electronic 
cigarette exposure. Elucidating the relationship between these pathways and the 
increased circulating mitochondrial DNA observed here will provide further 
insight into the cell-damaging effects of prolonged inhalation of e-cigarette 
aerosols.

Caffeine is a mild stimulant with significant potential for abuse, being 
consumed in larger doses with the widespread availability of energy drinks and 
by novel routes of administration such as inspired powder, oral sprays and 
electronic cigarettes. How these recent changes in caffeine consumption 
affecting caffeine disposition and abuse potential is of growing concern. In the 
study of caffeine disposition in humans, it is common to only measure the 
caffeine concentration; however, caffeine's three major metabolites 
(paraxanthine, theobromine and theophylline) retain central nervous system 
stimulant activity that may contribute to the overall pharmacological activity 
and toxicity. Therefore, it would be scientifically more rigorous to measure 
caffeine and its major metabolites in the evaluation of caffeine disposition in 
human subjects. Herein, we report a method for the simultaneous quantification 
of caffeine and its three major metabolites in human plasma by high-performance 
liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray tandem mass spectrometry 
(HPLC-ESI-MS/MS). Human plasma samples were treated by simple protein 
precipitation and the analytes were separated using a 6 min gradient program. 
Precision and accuracy were well within in the 15% acceptance range. The simple 
sample preparation, short runtime, sensitivity and the inclusion of caffeine's 
major metabolites make this assay methodology optimal for the study of 
caffeine's pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in human subjects.

Effect of chronic vapor nicotine exposure on affective and cognitive behavior in 
male mice.

    Sci Rep. 2024 Mar 19;14(1):6646.

Nicotine use is a leading cause of preventable deaths worldwide, and most of 
those who attempt to quit will relapse. While electronic cigarettes and other 
electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) were presented as a safer 
alternative to traditional cigarettes and promoted as devices to help 
traditional tobacco smokers reduce or quit smoking, they have instead 
contributed to increasing nicotine use among youths. Despite this, ENDS also 
represent a useful tool to create novel preclinical animal models of nicotine 
exposure that more accurately represent human nicotine use. In this study, we 
validated a chronic, intermittent, ENDS-based passive vapor exposure model in 
mice, and then measured changes in multiple behaviors related to nicotine 
abstinence. First, we performed a behavioral dose curve to investigate the 
effects of different nicotine inter-vape intervals on various measures including 
body weight, locomotor activity, and pain hypersensitivity. Next, we performed a 
pharmacokinetic study to measure plasma levels of nicotine and cotinine 
following chronic exposure for each inter-vape interval. Finally, we utilized a 
behavior test battery at a single dosing regimen that produces blood levels 
equivalent to human smokers in order to characterize the effects of chronic 
nicotine, vehicle, or passive airflow and identified nicotine-induced 
impairments in cognitive behavior.

Tobacco use remains a global problem, and options for consumers have increased 
with the development and marketing of e-cigarettes and other new nicotine and 
tobacco products, such as "heat-not-burn" tobacco and dissolvable tobacco. The 
increased access to these new products is juxtaposed with expanding public 
health and clinical intervention options, including mobile technologies and 
social media. The persistent high rate of tobacco-use disorders among those with 
psychiatric disorders has gathered increased global attention, including 
successful approaches to individual treatment and organizational-level 
interventions. Best outcomes occur when medications are integrated with 
behavioral therapies and community-based interventions. Addressing tobacco in 
mental health settings requires training and technical assistance to remove old 
cultural barriers that restricted interventions. There is still "low-hanging 
fruit" to be gained in educating on the proper use of nicotine replacement 
medications, how smoking cessation can change blood levels of specific 
medications and caffeine, and how to connect with quitlines and mobile 
technology options. Future innovations are likely to be related to 
pharmacogenomics and new technologies that are human-, home-, and 
community-facing.

1. The most important way to prevent atherosclerotic vascular disease, heart 
failure, and atrial fibrillation is to promote a healthy lifestyle throughout 
life. 2. A team-based care approach is an effective strategy for the prevention 
of cardiovascular disease. Clinicians should evaluate the social determinants of 
health that affect individuals to inform treatment decisions. 3. Adults who are 
40 to 75 years of age and are being evaluated for cardiovascular disease 
prevention should undergo 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) 
risk estimation and have a clinician–patient risk discussion before starting on 
pharmacological therapy, such as antihypertensive therapy, a statin, or aspirin. 
The presence or absence of additional risk-enhancing factors can help guide 
decisions about preventive interventions in select individuals, as can coronary 
artery calcium scanning. 4. All adults should consume a healthy diet that 
emphasizes the intake of vegetables, fruits, nuts, whole grains, lean vegetable 
or animal protein, and fish and minimizes the intake of trans fats, processed 
meats, refined carbohydrates, and sweetened beverages. For adults with 
overweight and obesity, counseling and caloric restriction are recommended for 
achieving and maintaining weight loss. 5. Adults should engage in at least 150 
minutes per week of accumulated moderate-intensity physical activity or 75 
minutes per week of vigorous-intensity physical activity. 6. For adults with 
type 2 diabetes mellitus, lifestyle changes, such as improving dietary habits 
and achieving exercise recommendations are crucial. If medication is indicated, 
metformin is first-line therapy, followed by consideration of a sodium-glucose 
cotransporter 2 inhibitor or a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist. 7. All 
adults should be assessed at every healthcare visit for tobacco use, and those 
who use tobacco should be assisted and strongly advised to quit. 8. Aspirin 
should be used infrequently in the routine primary prevention of ASCVD because 
of lack of net benefit. 9. Statin therapy is first-line treatment for primary 
prevention of ASCVD in patients with elevated low-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol levels (≥190 mg/dL), those with diabetes mellitus, who are 40 to 75 
years of age, and those determined to be at sufficient ASCVD risk after a 
clinician–patient risk discussion. 10. Nonpharmacological interventions are 
recommended for all adults with elevated blood pressure or hypertension. For 
those requiring pharmacological therapy, the target blood pressure should 
generally be <130/80 mm Hg.

OBJECTIVE: The present study evaluated distinct facets of impulsivity related to 
cardiometabolic risk (CMR) to identify specific behavioral mechanisms driving 
these relationships.
METHOD: Community adults (N = 1,295) between 30 and 54 years old (53% female, 
84% White) completed a battery of impulsivity measures, reported their 
engagement in health behaviors over the past week (i.e., cigarette smoking, 
alcohol use, physical activity, and dietary intake), and were assessed for CMR 
factors (i.e., blood pressure, insulin resistance, adiposity, and blood lipids). 
Structural equation modeling was used to estimate previously established 
hierarchical models of distinct facets of impulsivity and CMR. Indirect effects 
through the observed health behaviors were examined for each association between 
the latent impulsivity factors identified and the latent CMR factor.
RESULTS: Neuroticism/negative emotionality was the only latent impulsivity 
factor directly related to heightened CMR (β = 0.09, 95% confidence interval 
[CI] [0.01, 0.16], p = .020). Extraversion/positive emotionality indirectly 
related to lower CMR through greater physical activity (β = -0.04, 95% CI 
[-0.06, -0.02], p < .001), and measures of inhibition (β = 0.02, 95% CI [0.001, 
0.04], p = .045) and delay discounting (β = 0.08, 95% CI [0.001, 0.15], p = 
.049) indirectly related to CMR through saturated fat intake.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that distinct facets of impulsivity 
differentially relate to CMR through varied behavioral pathways and identify 
physical activity and saturated fat intake as being particularly important 
health behaviors to target when tailoring treatment approaches to the unique 
behavioral characteristics of individuals high on certain facets of impulsivity.

Cigarette smoking has been considered a major public health concern due to its 
serious impact on health. However, smokers intending to quit may find long-term 
abstinence challenging. When smoking an electronic cigarette (EC), users can 
experience a sensation and taste similar to that of smoking a combustible 
cigarette. Therefore, manufacturers promote these products as a viable 
substitute for combustible cigarettes. However, several researchers report the 
serious health impacts experienced by EC users. Therefore, this review aims to 
examine the health impacts of EC use. Based on the findings of the research 
papers reported in the literature, the role of EC as a smoking cessation tool is 
unclear. Several researchers have also reported a significant association 
between EC usage among non-smokers at baseline and the future initiation of 
combustible cigarette smoking. EC use significantly impacts user health. The 
nicotine that is present in EC e-liquids can elevate blood pressure, resulting 
in blood vessel constriction and an increase in heart rate, ultimately leading 
the body to an ischemic condition, resulting in myocardial infarction (MI), 
stroke, and increased arterial stiffness. Researchers report a higher likelihood 
of prediabetes among EC users; its usage was associated with higher OR of having 
asthma attacks and higher OR of reporting depression and has an impact on birth 
outcomes among pregnant women. Men using EC are more likely to report erectile 
dysfunction than non-users. EC also has a significant impact on oral health, 
which includes periodontal diseases, mucosal lesions, irritation in the mouth 
and throat, reduced salivary flow, and an increased risk of developing cancer. 
The physical injury resulting from exploding EC is another health concern. The 
frequently burned areas included the hands, face, genitalia, and thighs. 
Marketers promote EC as an alternative to combustible cigarettes and a tool for 
quitting smoking. However, the Food and Drug Administration has not approved 
them for smoking cessation. EC can have a serious impact on the health of their 
users; hence, the findings of this paper have several implications, including 
the need for regulation of the sales and marketing of these products and 
educating the users on the impact of these products on their health and safety.

Chronic disease prevalence in young adults is increasing with 15-20 % reporting 
1 or more chronic diseases. This study examined cross-sectional and prospective 
relationships between chronic disease and e-cigarette/cigarette use from young 
adulthood to adulthood utilizing the U.S.- based National Longitudinal Study of 
Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health). Add Health Study wave 3 (2001-2002; 
ages 18-26), wave 4 (2008; ages 24-34), and wave 5 (2016-2018; ages 33-44) were 
used. Past 30-day cigarette use at waves 3-5 and past 30-day e-cigarette use at 
wave 5 were assessed. Two measures of chronic disease were used: asthma (yes/no) 
and non-asthmatic chronic disease (yes/no) composed of 7 additional chronic 
diseases (diabetes, migraine, heart problem, hepatitis B/C, high blood pressure, 
epilepsy, and cancer). Weighted multilevel logistic regression (controlling for 
age, race/ethnicity, gender, and education) was used to assess cross-sectional 
associations at wave 3, and then prospective associations of wave 3 chronic 
disease (asthma and non-asthmatic) with waves 4 and 5 cigarette and wave 5 
e-cigarette use. Logistic regressions showed no significant cross-sectional or 
prospective relationships between asthma and cigarette and e-cigarette use. 
However, wave 3 non-asthmatic chronic disease was significantly associated with 
wave 4 cigarette use (aOR 1.38, p <.001, 95 % CI: 1.15, 1.65) and with wave 5 
cigarette use (aOR 1.49, p <.001, 95 % CI: 1.21, 1.84) but not e-cigarette use. 
The association between chronic disease in young adulthood and tobacco use in 
adulthood differed by type of chronic disease and tobacco product, indicating 
the need for targeted interventions.

Acute carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning is known to cause neurological, metabolic 
and cardiorespiratory sequalae. However, data on chronic CO exposure are scant, 
particularly in the context of vaping, which recent literature suggests may be a 
greater source of CO than tobacco cigarette smoking. During a series of 
admissions at the time of vaping, our patient repeatedly presented with 
significant CO poisoning and developed pulmonary arterial hypertension with 
resultant high-output right heart failure. On each occasion, our patient's 
levels of carboxyhaemoglobin were both higher and took longer to resolve than 12 
smokers who underwent arterial blood gas testing at two time points. Our 
observation may reveal an association between vaping, chronic 
carboxyhaemoglobinemia and the development of cardiorespiratory disease. Thus, 
further studies into the safety of vaping and chronic CO exposure are urged.

Smokers, and even non-smokers, may utilize vaporized nicotine delivered by 
electronic cigarette (EC) due to the perception that EC are "healthier" than 
traditional tobacco cigarettes. The effects of vaporized nicotine delivered by 
EC on resting blood pressure (BP) and resting metabolic rate (RMR), or BP and 
aerobic power during exercise have not been studied. This investigation tested 
the effects of acute vaporized nicotine inhalation by EC on resting BP and RMR 
and cycle exercise BP, metabolic responses, and aerobic power in young, 
normotensive non-smokers. Using a double-blind design, 20 subjects (10 female) 
participated in two randomized trials: placebo (0 mg nicotine) or nicotine (18 
mg nicotine). Participants inhaled from EC once every 30 s for 10 min (20 
inhalations total). RMR was assessed 40 min later by indirect calorimetry 
followed by an incremental cycle test. RMR was not different between trials 
(p=0.79). Compared to the placebo, resting diastolic pressure (DBP) was 3 mmHg 
higher with nicotine (p=0.04). VO2peak was not different between the nicotine 
trial (2.3±0.8 L•min-1) and placebo (2.3±0.7 L•min-1) trials (p=0.77), and Wmax 
was also similar between nicotine (201.0±53.8 W) and the placebo (204.8±57.8 W) 
(p=0.29). During the cycle exercise test, average DBP was higher following 
nicotine use compared with placebo trial (p=0.05), and exercise DBPpeak after 
nicotine (79.4±7.6) was significantly higher than placebo (74.9±8.3 mmHg) 
(p=0.02). Resting systolic blood pressure (SBP) was 3.7 mmHg lower for nicotine 
trial (p=0.04) but no SBP treatment effect was observed during exercise 
(p=0.14). Our results show that acute vaporized nicotine inhalation via EC 
increases resting and exercise DBP but does not affect RMR or cycle aerobic 
power in young, normotensive non-smokers.

The use of e-cigarettes has tremendously increased in recent times due to the 
widespread availability of e-cigarettes in diverse flavors, reduced cost 
compared to regular cigarettes, and misconception of being comparatively safe, 
which have led to around 2.55 million US middle and high school students smoking 
e-cigarettes. These devices use a nicotine-rich liquid, which is aerosolized 
electronically, producing vapors that may also include hazardous chemicals and 
heavy metals. E-cigarettes are associated with e-cigarette or vaping-associated 
lung injury, which presents as an acute respiratory ailment mirroring various 
pulmonary diseases. Additionally, it causes endothelial dysfunction, alters 
blood lipid profile by elevating circulating levels of low-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol, increases sympathetic tone, and is found to correlate with arterial 
stiffening, hence negatively affecting respiratory, cardiovascular, and overall 
health. We aim to provide a comprehensive analysis of the data on e-cigarettes 
and their harmful effects on health in comparison to conventional cigarette use 
by highlighting the pathophysiology of e-cigarette-induced adverse effects and 
critically analyzing the data both in favor and against its use. Our review 
concludes that no matter how much nicotine an e-cigarette contains, evidence 
shows that using it increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, albeit maybe 
not as much as smoking regular tobacco. Nonetheless, it is crucial to note that 
the long-term effects of e-cigarette usage are still not fully understood, and 
existing data have provided opposing viewpoints.

BACKGROUND: Although millions of people are using electronic cigarettes (ECs) 
and research on this topic has intensified in recent years, the pattern of EC 
use has not been systematically studied. Additionally, no comparative measure of 
exposure and nicotine delivery between EC and tobacco cigarette or nicotine 
replacement therapy (NRTs) has been established. This is important, especially 
in the context of the proposal for a new Tobacco Product Directive issued by the 
European Commission.
METHODS: A second generation EC device, consisting of a higher capacity battery 
and tank atomiser design compared to smaller cigarette-like batteries and 
cartomizers, and a 9 mg/mL nicotine-concentration liquid were used in this 
study. Eighty subjects were recruited; 45 experienced EC users and 35 smokers. 
EC users were video-recorded when using the device (ECIG group), while smokers 
were recorded when smoking (SM-S group) and when using the EC (SM-E group) in a 
randomized cross-over design. Puff, inhalation and exhalation duration were 
measured. Additionally, the amount of EC liquid consumed by experienced EC users 
was measured at 5 min (similar to the time needed to smoke one tobacco 
cigarette) and at 20 min (similar to the time needed for a nicotine inhaler to 
deliver 4 mg nicotine).
RESULTS: Puff duration was significantly higher in ECIG (4.2 ± 0.7 s) compared 
to SM-S (2.1 ± 0.4 s) and SM-E (2.3 ± 0.5 s), while inhalation time was lower 
(1.3 ± 0.4, 2.1 ± 0.4 and 2.1 ± 0.4 respectively). No difference was observed in 
exhalation duration. EC users took 13 puffs and consumed 62 ± 16 mg liquid in 5 
min; they took 43 puffs and consumed 219 ± 56 mg liquid in 20 min. Nicotine 
delivery was estimated at 0.46 ± 0.12 mg after 5 min and 1.63 ± 0.41 mg after 20 
min of use. Therefore, 20.8 mg/mL and 23.8 mg/mL nicotine-containing liquids 
would deliver 1 mg of nicotine in 5 min and 4 mg nicotine in 20 min, 
respectively. Since the ISO method significantly underestimates nicotine 
delivery by tobacco cigarettes, it seems that liquids with even higher than 24 
mg/mL nicotine concentration would be comparable to one tobacco cigarette.
CONCLUSIONS: EC use topography is significantly different compared to smoking. 
Four-second puffs with 20-30 s interpuff interval should be used when assessing 
EC effects in laboratory experiments, provided that the equipment used does not 
get overheated. Based on the characteristics of the device used in this study, a 
20 mg/mL nicotine concentration liquid would be needed in order to deliver 
nicotine at amounts similar to the maximum allowable content of one tobacco 
cigarette (as measured by the ISO 3308 method). The results of this study do not 
support the statement of the European Commission Tobacco Product Directive that 
liquids with nicotine concentration of 4 mg/mL are comparable to NRTs in the 
amount of nicotine delivered to the user.

RATIONALE: It is unclear if e-cigarettes have reduced abuse liability relative 
to traditional cigarettes, especially when considering advanced devices which 
deliver nicotine more efficiently. Translatable and predictive animal models are 
needed to addresses this question.
OBJECTIVES: Our goal was to explore the subjective stimulus effects of 
e-cigarettes by training rats to discriminate puffs of nicotine aerosol from 
vehicle aerosol using an aerosol delivery system designed to model e-cigarette 
use patterns in humans.
METHODS: Rats were trained to discriminate between ten, 10 s puffs of aerosol 
generated from 3 mg/ml nicotine e-liquid and nicotine-free e-liquid using a 
food-reinforced operant procedure. Following acquisition, tests were conducted 
to determine the specificity of the nicotine aerosol stimulus as well as the 
impact to the stimulus effects of nicotine resulting from the addition of 
menthol to e-liquid.
RESULTS: Rats learned the nicotine aerosol puff vs vehicle puff discrimination 
in a mean of 25 training sessions. Injected nicotine fully substituted for the 
stimulus effects of nicotine aerosol. The stimulus effects of nicotine aerosol 
were blocked by the nicotinic receptor antagonist mecamylamine. The nicotinic 
receptor partial agonist, varenicline as well as the stimulant d-amphetamine 
substituted more robustly for nicotine aerosol puffs than did the NMDA 
antagonist, ketamine. Menthol enhanced the stimulus effects of nicotine aerosol 
without altering nicotine blood plasma levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Nicotine aerosol puffs can function as a training stimulus in rats. 
The stimulus effects were CNS-mediated and receptor specific. Menthol appears to 
enhance the stimulus effects of nicotine aerosol through a pharmacodynamic 
rather than pharmacokinetic mechanism.

Several substitute products are discussed as a healthier alternative to smoking, 
thereunder e-cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products, e.g., chewing bags, 
which are increasingly used in this context. We investigated the acute effects 
of chewing bags compared to combustible cigarettes and e-cigarettes with and 
without nicotine on small airways and arterial stiffness in a head-to-head 
design. This single-center, four-arm cross-overstudy included 20 healthy 
occasional smokers (25 ± 0.6 years). On four test days, participants consumed 
one product per day. Before, during, and after consumption, peripheral and 
central hemodynamic as well as arterial stiffness parameters were measured by 
Mobil-O-Graph™ (I.E.M., Germany). Resistance and small airway function were 
assessed by tremoFlo® c-100 (THORASYS Thoracic Medical Systems Inc.). The 
combustible cigarette and the e-cigarettes with and without nicotine 
significantly increased the resistance of the small airways (p < 0.05), while 
chewing bags had no effect. All nicotine containing products (e-cigarette with 
nicotine, combustible cigarette, chewing bag) as well as the e-cigarette without 
nicotine significantly increased parameters of hemodynamic and arterial 
stiffness. Changes in blood pressure and arterial stiffness were similar after 
smoking, vaping, and using chewing bags. We conclude that e-cigarettes and 
combustible cigarettes have similar acute harmful effects on small airway 
dysfunction. All nicotine containing products are associated with an increased 
cardiovascular risk compared with no product use.

BACKGROUND: There was little known on how the interaction effect between obesity 
and current smoking affected the incidence of hypertension. The aim of this 
study was to investigate how body mass index (BMI) modified the effect of 
current smoking on the incidence of hypertension.
METHODS: Data were obtained from the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS). 
According to the WHO recommendations for Chinese people, the normal weight, 
overweight, and obesity were defined using the BMI cutoff values 18.5 kg/m2, 
23.0 kg/m2, and 27.5 kg/m, respectively. Current smokers were defined as having 
smoked at least 100 cigarettes or electronic cigarettes, 20 cigars, or 20 
tobacco pipes and other type of tobacco in the last 30 days preceding the 
survey. Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP)/ diastolic 
blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 140/90 mmHg, use of anti-hypertensive medications, or a 
self-reported diagnosis.
RESULTS: This study included 12,900 subjects. There were interaction effects 
between obesity and current smoking in females (P = 0.030) and the 50-59 years 
group (P = 0.049). Current smoking was a significant predictor of incident 
hypertension only in the total and female populations with normal weight (HR: 
1.119 and 1.274; HR 95% CI: 1.013-1.236 and 1.143-1.415; and P = 0.027 and 
0.040, respectively). Stratified by age, current smoking affected the 
development of hypertension only in the 50-59 years subjects with the normal 
weight (HR: 1.356; HR 95% CI: 1.084-1.697; and P = 0.008).
CONCLUSIONS: Current smoking was a significant predictor of incident 
hypertension only in the female and middle-age populations with normal weight 
but not in the overweight and obesity as well as the younger and elder 
populations.

BACKGROUND: Popular "pod-style" e-cigarettes commonly use nicotine salt-based 
e-liquids that cause less irritation when inhaled and can deliver higher 
nicotine concentrations than free-base nicotine. We aimed to investigate the 
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of different nicotine formulations 
(salt vs. free-base) and concentrations that might influence systemic nicotine 
absorption and appeal of e-cigarettes.
METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, within-subject crossover study, 20 
non nicotine-naïve participants were switched among three e-liquids (free-base 
nicotine 20mg/mL, nicotine salt 20mg/mL, nicotine salt 40mg/mL) using a 
refillable pod system and a standardized vaping protocol (one puff every 30 
seconds, 10 puffs total). Serum nicotine concentrations and vital signs were 
assessed over 180 minutes; direct effects, craving, satisfaction, withdrawal, 
and respiratory symptoms were measured using questionnaires. CYP2A6 genotypes 
and the nicotine metabolite ratio were also assessed.
RESULTS: Eleven (55%) participants were male and the median age was 23.5 years 
(range 18-67). All three formulations differed significantly in peak serum 
nicotine concentration (baseline adjusted Cmax, median (range): 12.0ng/mL 
(1.6-27.3), 5.4ng/mL (1.9-18.7) and 3.0ng/mL (1.3-8.8) for nicotine salt 
40mg/mL, nicotine salt 20mg/mL and free-base 20mg/mL, respectively). All groups 
reached Cmax 2.0-2.5min (median) after their last puff. Differences in 
subjective effects were not statistically significant. No serious adverse events 
were observed.
CONCLUSION: Free-base 20mg/mL formulations achieved lower blood nicotine 
concentrations than nicotine salt 20mg/mL, while 40mg/mL nicotine salt yielded 
concentrations similar to cigarette smoking. The findings can inform regulatory 
policy regarding e-liquids and their potential use in smoking cessation.
IMPLICATIONS: Nicotine salt formulations inhaled by an e-cigarette led to higher 
nicotine delivery compared to nicotine free-base formulations with the same 
nicotine concentration. These findings should be considered in future regulatory 
discussions. The 40mg/mL nicotine salt formulation showed similar nicotine 
delivery as combustible cigarettes, albeit at concentrations over the maximum 
limit for e-liquids allowed in the European Union. Nicotine delivery resembling 
combustible cigarettes might be beneficial for smokers willing to quit to 
adequately alleviate withdrawal symptoms. However, increased nicotine delivery 
can also pose a public health risk, raising concerns about abuse liability, 
especially among youth and non-smokers.

and pharmacokinetic effects.

Cannabis is the most frequently used illicit drug among pregnant women, yet the 
potential consequences of prenatal cannabis exposure on development are not well 
understood. Electronic cigarettes have become an increasingly popular route of 
administration among pregnant women, in part to user's perception that 
e-cigarettes are a safer route for consuming cannabis products. Importantly, 
half of pregnant women who consume cannabis also report consuming alcohol, but 
research investigating co-consumption of these drugs is limited, particularly 
with current routes of administration. The purpose of this study was to 
establish a co-exposure vapor inhalation model of alcohol and THC in pregnant 
rats, to ultimately determine the effects on fetal development. Pregnant 
Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to moderate doses of THC via e-cigarettes, 
alcohol, the combination, or vehicle daily from gestational days 5-20. 
Importantly, pharmacokinetic interactions of alcohol and THC were observed 
during pregnancy. Combined exposure consistently increased blood alcohol 
concentrations, indicating that THC alters alcohol metabolism. In addition, THC 
levels also increased over the course of pregnancy and THC metabolism was 
altered by alcohol. Alcohol, but not THC, exposure during pregnancy reduced 
maternal weight gain, despite no group differences in food intake. Neither 
prenatal alcohol nor THC exposure altered gestational length, litter size, sex 
ratio or birth weight. However, prenatal alcohol exposure delayed eye opening, 
and prenatal THC exposure decreased body weights during adolescence among 
offspring. These individual and synergistic effects suggest that this novel 
co-exposure vapor inhalation paradigm can effectively be used to expose pregnant 
dams, exerting some effects on fetal development, while avoiding nutritional 
confounds, birth complications, or changes in litter size. With this model, we 
have demonstrated that combining THC and alcohol alters drug metabolism, which 
could have important consequences on prenatal development.

INTRODUCTION: Health care researchers and delivery system leaders share a common 
mission to improve health care quality and outcomes. However, differing 
timelines, incentives, and priorities are often a barrier to research and 
operational partnerships. In addition, few funding mechanisms exist to generate 
and solicit analytic questions that are of interest to both research and to 
operations within health care settings, and provide rapid results that can be 
used to improve practice and outcomes.
METHODS: The Delivery Science Rapid Analysis Program (RAP) was formed in 2013 
within the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Division of Research, sponsored 
by The Permanente Medical Group. A Steering Committee consisting of both 
researchers and clinical leaders solicits and reviews proposals for rapid 
analytic projects that will use existing data and are feasible within 6 months 
and with up to $30,000 (approximately 25-50% full-time equivalent) of 
programmer/analyst effort. Review criteria include the importance of the 
analytic question for both research and operations, and the potential for the 
project to have a significant impact on care delivery within 12 months of 
completion.
RESULTS: The RAP funded 5 research and operational analytic projects between 
2013 and 2017. These projects spanned a wide range of clinical areas, including 
lupus, pediatric obesity, diabetes, e-cigarette use, and hypertension. The 
hypertension RAP project, which focused on optimizing thiazide prescribing in 
Black/African-American patients with hypertension, led to new insights that 
inform an equitable care quality metric designed to reduce blood pressure 
control disparities throughout the KPNC region.
CONCLUSIONS: Programs that actively encourage research and operational analytic 
partnerships have significant potential to improve care, enhance research 
collaborations, and contribute to the building and sustaining of learning health 
care systems.

INTRODUCTION: Nicotine and tobacco use remain high both globally and in the USA, 
contributing to large healthcare expenditures. With a rise in e-cigarette use, 
it is important to have clinically relevant models of inhaled nicotine exposure. 
This study aims to extend prior preclinical nicotine inhalation animal data to 
females and provide both behavior and serum pharmacokinetics.
METHODS: We tested two inhalation doses of nicotine (24 mg/ml and 59 mg/ml) and 
compared these to injected doses (0.4 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg). In addition, we 
assessed locomotor behavior after the same doses. Blood was collected at 10- and 
120-minutes post-administration. We assessed nicotine and cotinine serum 
concentrations by LC-MS/MS.
RESULTS: showed that while nicotine serum concentrations for the respective high 
and low-dose administrations were similar between both routes of administration, 
the route had differential effects on locomotor behavior. Inhaled nicotine 
showed a dose-dependent decrease in locomotor activity while injected doses 
showed the opposite trend.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the route of administration is an 
important factor when establishing preclinical models of nicotine exposures. 
Given that the overall use of e-cigarettes in vulnerable populations is on the 
rise, our study provides important behavioral and pharmacokinetic information to 
advance our currently limited understanding of the effects of nicotine vapor 
exposure.
IMPLICATIONS: This study highlights behavioral differences between different 
routes of administration of similar doses of nicotine. Using a low and high dose 
of nicotine, we found that nicotine serum concentrations were similar between 
the different routes of administration. Our results indicate that different 
routes of administration have opposing effects on locomotor activity. These 
findings provide important implications for future behavioral models.

Electronic cigarettes are becoming increasingly common as a form of nicotine 
usage, known as vaping. Numerous studies have demonstrated that using electronic 
cigarettes may lead to nicotine dependence and has a potentially harmful impact 
on health. The present study compared the impact of electronic and conventional 
cigarettes on lung tissue. The experiment included 30 male Wistar rats. The 
animals were divided into three groups: Group A was exposed to electronic 
cigarette liquid vapour; group B to conventional smoke; and group C constituted 
the control group without exposition to the nicotine. In both experimental 
groups numerous alterations were observed, including a collapse of parenchyma, 
hyperhagia, hyperplasia of type II of pneumocytes, collagen deposition and an 
increased number of macrophages within thickened alveolar septa. Additionally, 
an initial elastolysis was observed. The elastic fibers were disrupted, sparse, 
irregular and thickened, whereas the numbers of α-SMA positive myofibroblasts 
and blood vessels were highest in the group exposed to conventional cigarette 
smoke. In conclusion, the usage of the electronic cigarettes leads to milder 
pathological alterations compared with traditional cigarette smoking. 
Nevertheless, the histopathological damage caused by vaping may lead to the 
development of alterations in the lung tissue which consequently hinder gas 
exchange.

INTRODUCTION: Smoke from traditional cigarettes and e-cigarette aerosols have 
distinct chemical compositions that may impact blood pressure (BP) and heart 
rate (HR) differently.
AIMS: This study compared the impact of nicotine-containing e-cigarettes (EC+) 
versus nicotine-free (EC-) on BP, HR and endothelial markers, and assessed if 
EC+ posed fewer risks than tobacco cigarettes (TC).
METHODS: Electronic databases were searched from inception until November 2023 
for studies reporting changes in systolic and diastolic BP (SBP, DBP) and HR and 
endothelial parameters before and after the use of EC+, EC- and TC. Data were 
analyzed using weighted mean differences (WMDs) and 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs).
RESULTS: Fifteen studies (n = 752) were included in our meta-analysis. We 
demonstrate that EC+ significantly increased systolic BP (WMD = 3.41, 95% CI 
[0.1,6.73], p = 0.04], diastolic BP (WMD = 3.42, 95% CI [1.75, 5.09]; p < 0.01], 
and HR (WMD = 5.36 BPM, 95% CI [1.87, 8.85]; p < 0.01) compared to EC-. However, 
EC+ was observed to cause less detrimental effect on SBP (WMD = - 4.72 mmHg, 95% 
CI [- 6.58, - 2.86], p < 0.01), and HR (WMD = - 3.11 BPM, 95% CI [- 4.54, 
- 1.68]; p < 0.01) as compared to TC with no difference on DBP 
(WMD = - 1.14 mmHg, 95% CI [- 2.38, 0.1]; p = 0.07). EC+ also led to greater 
deterioration of endothelial parameters as compared to EC- but to a lesser 
degree as compared to TC.
CONCLUSION: EC+ shows greater impairment in hemodynamic and endothelial 
parameters than EC- but less than TC. Additional studies are needed to evaluate 
prolonged effects of EC use.

Objective: Evolving patterns of nicotine and cannabis use by adolescents require 
new tools to understand the changing epidemiology of these substances. Here we 
describe the use of a novel epigenetic biomarker sensitive to both tobacco and 
cannabis smoke in a longitudinal sample of high-risk adolescents. We examine 
risk factors for positivity for this epigenetic biomarker in comparison to 
positivity for conventional serum biomarkers of nicotine and cannabis use. 
Method: Eastern Iowa 10th graders who had a friend or family member who smoked 
were eligible to participate in a longitudinal study over 10-12th grades. 
Subjects provided self-report data on nicotine, tobacco, and cannabis use 
patterns as well as blood samples that were used for serum cotinine and THC 
assays. DNA was prepared for analysis of methylation at the CpG cg05575921, a 
sensitive indicator of smoke exposure. Relationships between positivity for each 
these biomarkers and a variety of risk factors, including demographics, family 
and peer relationships, psychopathology, willingness to smoke, and perceptions 
of typical cigarette and cannabis users, were examined at the 10th (n = 442), 
11th (n = 376), and 12th (n = 366) grade timepoints. Results: A increasing 
proportion of subjects were positive for cotinine (5-16%), THC (3-10%), and 
cg05575921 methylation (5-7%) across timepoints, with some overlap. 
Self-reported combusted tobacco and cannabis use was strongly correlated with 
all biomarkers, whereas cg05575921 methylation was not correlated with reported 
e-cigarette use. Dual users, defined as those positive for nicotine and THC in 
the 12th grade showed the greatest cumulative smoke exposure, indicated by 
cg05575921 methylation. Subjects reported more positive attitudes toward 
cannabis users than cigarette smokers, and willingness to smoke and positive 
perceptions of tobacco and cannabis smokers were significant risk factors for 
biomarker positivity across timepoints. Conclusion: We conclude that measurement 
of cg05575921 methylation in adolescents is a useful tool in detecting tobacco 
smoking in adolescents, and may be a novel tool for the detection of cannabis 
smoking and cannabis and tobacco co-use, though non-combusted forms of nicotine 
use do not appear to be detectable by this method.

BACKGROUND: Heated tobacco products (HTPs) are designed to heat tobacco to a 
high enough temperature to release aerosol, without burning it or producing 
smoke. They differ from e-cigarettes because they heat tobacco leaf/sheet rather 
than a liquid. Companies who make HTPs claim they produce fewer harmful 
chemicals than conventional cigarettes. Some people report stopping smoking 
cigarettes entirely by switching to using HTPs, so clinicians need to know 
whether they are effective for this purpose and relatively safe. Also, to 
regulate HTPs appropriately, policymakers should understand their impact on 
health and on cigarette smoking prevalence.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of HTPs for smoking 
cessation and the impact of HTPs on smoking prevalence.  SEARCH METHODS: We 
searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, 
MEDLINE, and six other databases for relevant records to January 2021, together 
with reference-checking and contact with study authors and relevant groups.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which 
people who smoked cigarettes were randomised to switch to exclusive HTP use or a 
control condition. Eligible outcomes were smoking cessation, adverse events, and 
selected biomarkers.  RCTs conducted in clinic or in an ambulatory setting were 
deemed eligible when assessing safety, including those randomising participants 
to exclusively use HTPs, smoke cigarettes, or attempt abstinence from all 
tobacco. Time-series studies were also eligible for inclusion if they examined 
the population-level impact of heated tobacco on smoking prevalence or cigarette 
sales as an indirect measure.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We followed standard Cochrane methods for 
screening and data extraction. Our primary outcome measures were abstinence from 
smoking at the longest follow-up point available, adverse events, serious 
adverse events, and changes in smoking prevalence or cigarette sales. Other 
outcomes included biomarkers of harm and exposure to toxicants/carcinogens (e.g. 
NNAL and carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb)). We used a random-effects Mantel-Haenszel 
model to calculate risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for 
dichotomous outcomes. For continuous outcomes, we calculated mean differences on 
the log-transformed scale (LMD) with 95% CIs. We pooled data across studies 
using meta-analysis where possible.
MAIN RESULTS: We included 13 completed studies, of which 11 were RCTs assessing 
safety (2666 participants) and two were time-series studies. We judged eight 
RCTs to be at unclear risk of bias and three at high risk. All RCTs were funded 
by tobacco companies. Median length of follow-up was 13 weeks. No studies 
reported smoking cessation outcomes.  There was insufficient evidence for a 
difference in risk of adverse events between smokers randomised to switch to 
heated tobacco or continue smoking cigarettes, limited by imprecision and risk 
of bias (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.15; I2 = 0%; 6 studies, 1713 
participants). There was insufficient evidence to determine whether risk of 
serious adverse events differed between groups due to very serious imprecision 
and risk of bias (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.94; I2 = 0%; 4 studies, 1472 
participants). There was moderate-certainty evidence for lower NNAL and COHb at 
follow-up in heated tobacco than cigarette smoking groups, limited by risk of 
bias (NNAL: LMD -0.81, 95% CI -1.07 to -0.55; I2 = 92%; 10 studies, 1959 
participants; COHb: LMD -0.74, 95% CI -0.92 to -0.52; I2 = 96%; 9 studies, 1807 
participants). Evidence for additional biomarkers of exposure are reported in 
the main body of the review. There was insufficient evidence for a difference in 
risk of adverse events in smokers randomised to switch to heated tobacco or 
attempt abstinence from all tobacco, limited by risk of bias and imprecision (RR 
1.12, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.46; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 237 participants). Five studies 
reported that no serious adverse events occurred in either group (533 
participants). There was moderate-certainty evidence, limited by risk of bias, 
that urine concentrations of NNAL at follow-up were higher in the heated tobacco 
use compared with abstinence group (LMD 0.50, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.66; I2 = 0%; 5 
studies, 382 participants). In addition, there was very low-certainty evidence, 
limited by risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision, for higher COHb in the 
heated tobacco use compared with abstinence group for intention-to-treat 
analyses (LMD 0.69, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.31; 3 studies, 212 participants), but lower 
COHb in per-protocol analyses (LMD -0.32, 95% CI -1.04 to 0.39; 2 studies, 170 
participants). Evidence concerning additional biomarkers is reported in the main 
body of the review. Data from two time-series studies showed that the rate of 
decline in cigarette sales accelerated following the introduction of heated 
tobacco to market in Japan. This evidence was of very low-certainty as there was 
risk of bias, including possible confounding, and cigarette sales are an 
indirect measure of smoking prevalence.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: No studies reported on cigarette smoking cessation, so the 
effectiveness of heated tobacco for this purpose remains uncertain. There was 
insufficient evidence for differences in risk of adverse or serious adverse 
events between people randomised to switch to heated tobacco, smoke cigarettes, 
or attempt tobacco abstinence in the short-term. There was moderate-certainty 
evidence that heated tobacco users have lower exposure to toxicants/carcinogens 
than cigarette smokers and very low- to moderate-certainty evidence of higher 
exposure than those attempting abstinence from  all tobacco. Independently 
funded research on the effectiveness and safety of HTPs is needed.  The rate of 
decline in cigarette sales accelerated after the introduction of heated tobacco 
to market in Japan but, as data were observational, it is possible other factors 
caused these changes. Moreover, falls in cigarette sales may not translate to 
declining smoking prevalence, and changes in Japan may not generalise elsewhere. 
To clarify the impact of rising heated tobacco use on smoking prevalence, there 
is a need for time-series studies that examine this association.

BACKGROUND: Haramonting leaves have a large antioxidant activity as inhibitors 
oxidation and form non-free radical compounds that are not reactive and 
relatively stable. Electronic smoking is a choice who slowly want to quit 
conventional smoking.
AIM: This research aimed to determine the effect of ethanol extract on hard 
mounting leaves on leukocyte counts and histology Pulmo on male mice exposed to 
an electronic cigarette.
METHODS: The samples used in this study were healthy male mice aged 8-11 weeks 
and weight of 25-30 g as many as 25 individuals and ethanol extracts of hard 
mounting leaves with a dose of 100 mg/kgBW, 200 mg/kgBW and 300 mg/kgBW. Blood 
tests were carried out at the Health Laboratory of North Sumatra Office, and the 
preparation of Pulmo histology was carried out at the Pathology and Anatomy 
Laboratory of Adam Malik General Hospital Medan.
RESULT: There were significant differences between the control group and all of 
the treatment groups in the number of lymphocytes, neutrophils, basophils and 
eosinophils. There was a tendency that electronic cigarette smoke could cause 
damage to pulmo tissue.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that the ethanol extract of hard 
mounting leaves could help the immune system in mice exposed to an electronic 
cigarette.

the literature.

Several regulatory initiatives around the world restrict the amount of nicotine 
permitted in electronic cigarette liquids in an attempt to reproduce the 
nicotine delivery of combusted tobacco products, such as cigarettes, and or 
reduce the risk of consumers absorbing too much nicotine into their body at one 
time. Such an approach, however, assumes that (i) there is a strong correlation 
between the levels of nicotine in electronic cigarette liquids and nicotine 
intake into the body and (ii) that this correlation holds true across the 
various different types of electronic cigarette devices currently available on 
the market. In order to test these hypotheses, this study examines the available 
scientific literature on nicotine intake from electronic cigarettes, as measured 
by levels in the blood. Analysis of the published data reveals that nicotine 
absorption into the body is influenced by a combination of many factors, 
including electronic cigarette liquid composition, user behavior and device 
characteristics. Notably, it was observed that open-tank (refillable) electronic 
cigarettes, which often enable users to vary device power, can deliver high 
nicotine levels to consumers, sometimes at greater doses than a conventional 
tobacco cigarette, even at the lower nicotine liquid concentrations typically 
available. For electronic cigarettes to be viable alternative choices to 
smoking, they should provide consumers with an equally satisfying experience, 
including in terms of nicotine absorption into the body. Therefore, any 
regulation seeking to restrict the amount of nicotine in electronic cigarette 
liquids should take all the factors influencing nicotine intake into account.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Modified risk products (MRP) such as electronic vaping 
cigarettes (EVC) and heat-not-burn cigarettes (HNBC) are alternatives to 
traditional combustion cigarettes (TCC) with an expanding consumer base. Yet, 
their cardiovascular health risks are still unclear. We aimed to summarize the 
evidence base on this topic by conducting an updated umbrella review.
RECENT FINDINGS: We identified 7 systematic reviews, totaling 183 studies and 
reports, ranging from in vitro and in animal studies to clinical studies in 
apparently healthy volunteers and patients at risk of cardiovascular disease. 
Overall, acute EVC use was associated with several toxic effects at molecular, 
cellular, tissue, organ, and system level. In addition, EVC impacted adversely 
on blood pressure (BP) management, caused tachycardia, and worsened arterial 
stiffness. Finally, EVC use was associated with an increased risk of adverse 
clinical events, including atrial fibrillation and myocardial infarction, even 
if the causal link is still debated. Most reviews highlighted that the 
detrimental impact of EVC was of lesser magnitude of that of TCC. In addition, 
the differential impact of liquids and nicotine was not clearly disentangled. 
Finally, no review included studies on HNBC.
SUMMARY: The present umbrella review suggests that EVC, and likely HNBC, despite 
clearly causing an increase in overall cardiovascular risk, may represent a 
temporary lesser evil than TCC in a risk-reduction or risk-modification 
strategy, aiming for eventual abstinence from all tobacco or nicotine products.

Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) is a disabling stroke sub-type, and 
tobacco use is a prominent risk factor for sICH. We showed that chronic nicotine 
exposure enhances bleeding post-sICH. Reduction of hematoma growth is a 
promising effective therapy for sICH in smoking subjects. Red-blood-cell-derived 
microparticles (RMPs) are hemostatic agents that limit hematoma expansion 
following sICH in naïve rats. Considering the importance of testing the efficacy 
of experimental drugs in animal models with a risk factor for a disease, we 
tested RMP efficacy and the therapeutic time window in limiting hematoma growth 
post-sICH in rats exposed to nicotine. Young rats were chronically treated with 
nicotine using osmotic pumps. sICH was induced in rats using an injection of 
collagenase in the right striatum. Vehicle/RMPs were administered intravenously. 
Hematoma volume and neurological impairment were quantified ≈24 h after sICH. 
Hematoma volumes in male and female nicotine-exposed rats that were treated with 
RMPs at 2 h post-sICH were significantly lower by 26 and 31% when compared to 
their respective control groups. RMP therapy was able to limit hematoma volume 
when administered up to 4.5 h post-sICH in animals of both sexes. Therefore, 
RMPs may limit hematoma growth in sICH patients exposed to tobacco use.

INTRODUCTION: The vaping epidemic in the US has been largely attributed to the 
emergence of pod-based e-cigarette devices. While these devices continue to be 
promoted as alternatives to cigarettes, their impact on cardiovascular and 
behavioral outcomes remains incompletely understood. This study assessed the 
impact of pod-based e-cigarettes on peripheral and cerebral vascular function, 
along with subjective experiences among adult cigarette smokers.
METHODS: In a crossover laboratory design study, a total of 19 (e-cigarette 
naïve) cigarette smokers (aged 21-43 years) attended two lab sessions. In one 
session, participants smoked a cigarette and in the other, vaped a pod-based 
e-cigarette. Participants completed questions assessing subjective experiences. 
Peripheral macrovascular and microvascular function was assessed via brachial 
artery FMD and reactive hyperemia, while cerebral vascular function was assessed 
as the blood velocity response of the middle cerebral artery during hypercapnia. 
Measurements were taken before and after exposure.
RESULTS: Compared with baseline, there was a reduction in peripheral 
macrovascular function (indexed by FMD), following e-cigarette (pre=9.3±4.3%; 
post=6.4±4.1%) and cigarette use (pre=10.2±3.7%; post=6.8±3.8%; main effect of 
time p<0.0001). Cerebral vascular function (indexed by cerebral vasodilatory 
response during hypercapnia) was also reduced following e-cigarette (pre=53±19%; 
post=44±15%) and cigarette use (pre=54±21%; post=44±17%; main effect of time 
p<0.01). The magnitude of reduction in peripheral and cerebral vascular function 
was similar between conditions (condition × time, p>0.05). Compared with vaping 
an e-cigarette, participants scored higher for measures of satisfaction, taste, 
puff liking, and suppression of craving following smoking (p>0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Similar to smoking, vaping a pod-based e-cigarette leads to an 
impairment in peripheral and cerebral vascular function while providing a 
reduced subjective experience compared with a cigarette among adult smokers. 
While these data challenge the notion that e-cigarette use is a safe and 
satisfactory alternative to cigarette use, large longitudinal studies are needed 
to assess the long-term impact of pod-based e-cigarette devices on 
cardiovascular and behavioral outcomes.

INTRODUCTION: Approximately 9 million American adults use two or more tobacco 
products regularly, referred to as dual or poly tobacco users. In Alaska, where 
tobacco is not native, approximately 20% of the population smokes cigarettes, 
and among smokers, 10% use two or more tobacco products. Previous research 
suggests that dual tobacco product use may be especially high among Alaska 
Native people. The current study examined cultural and demographic 
characteristics associated with dual tobacco use.
METHODS: Alaska Native adults reporting daily smoking and identified with high 
blood pressure or cholesterol were recruited in the Norton Sound region of 
Alaska between 2015-2019 as part of a treatment trial targeting cardiovascular 
disease risk factors. Participants reported their tribal group, level of 
identification with their Alaska Native heritage, speaking of their tribal 
language, basic demographic characteristics, and past 30-day use of tobacco 
products in addition to smoking cigarettes.
RESULTS: Participants (n=299) were 48.5% female and identified as Yup'ik 
(31.1%), Inupiat (60.5%), and other or multiple tribal group(s) (8.4%). Most 
participants (85.3%) strongly identified with their Alaska Native heritage. Past 
30-day dual tobacco use was reported by 10.0%, specifically 9.0% chew/snuff, 
1.3% e-cigarettes, and 0.7% Iq'mik. Multivariate regression models indicated 
that dual tobacco use was more likely among men (OR=3.35; 95% CI: 1.30-8.64), 
younger participants (OR range: 10.97-12.35; 95% CI: 2.33-57.86), those 
identifying as Yup'ik (OR=2.86; 95% CI: 1.13-7.19), and those who identified 
very little or not at all with their Alaska Native heritage (OR=2.98; 95% CI: 
1.14-7.77).
CONCLUSIONS: Young men identifying as Yup'ik were more likely to use dual forms 
of tobacco. Stronger identification with one's Alaska Native heritage was 
associated with lower risk of dual tobacco use. The findings highlight cultural 
and demographic factors for further consideration and attention in tobacco 
cessation treatment interventions.

OBJECTIVE: This study's objective was to characterize the nicotine delivery 
profile of a variable voltage, tank-style electronic nicotine delivery system 
(ENDS).
METHODS: Ten cigarette smokers (8 men, 2 women) completed this within-subject 
study assessing effects of 2 device power settings (15 W, 45 W) and 3 liquid 
nicotine concentrations (0, 3, and 6 mg/ml) using a tank-style ENDS. 
Participants completed one directed (10 puffs) and one ad libitum use period for 
each condition, with blood sampled throughout.
RESULTS: Plasma nicotine concentration did not increase significantly at 15 W 
regardless of liquid nicotine concentration. At 45 W, mean plasma nicotine 
increased (not significantly compared to 0 mg/ml) from 2.24 ng/ml (SD=0.2) at 
baseline to 3.4 ng/ml (SD=0.6) in the 3 mg/ml condition. In the 6 mg/ml, 45 W 
condition, mean plasma nicotine increased significantly (compared to 0 mg/ml) 
from 2.0 ng/ml (SD=0) at baseline to 5.96 ng/ml (SD=1.3) after 10 puffs. In 
general, puff duration and volume decreased as device power and nicotine 
concentration increased.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite using a variable wattage, tank-style device, nicotine 
delivery was minimal. These results, when combined with results from other 
studies using tank-style devices, highlight ENDS performance heterogeneity. 
Regulation may play a role in standardizing ENDS nicotine delivery.

INTRODUCTION: Glaucoma is the main cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. 
Still, little is known about nonocular risk factors. We use an umbrella review 
to examine the meta-analytic evidence of the correlation between nonocular 
factors and glaucoma.
METHOD: We searched PubMed and Embase databases up to July 24, 2020. Eligible 
meta-analyses (MAs) included cohort, case-control, and randomized controlled 
study designs. Two authors independently extracted the data and evaluated the 
methodological quality of the MAs. AMSTAR 2 was used to assess the 
methodological quality of each included MA.
RESULTS: This umbrella review contains 22 MAs with 22 unique nonocular factors 
in total. We identified 11 factors that increase the risk of glaucoma: 
hyperlipidemia, nocturnal dip in blood pressure, infection with Helicobacter 
pylori, myopia, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, corneal properties, diabetes, 
hypertension, hypothyroidism, migraine, and plasma homocysteine. We identified 3 
factors that reduce the risk of glaucoma: dietary intake of vitamin A, dietary 
intake of vitamin C, and short-term statin use. We identified 8 factors that had 
no association with glaucoma: dietary intake of vitamin B, dietary intake of 
vitamin E, cigarette smoking, Alzheimer's disease, serum folic acid, serum 
vitamin B6, serum vitamin B12, and serum vitamin D.
CONCLUSIONS: In this umbrella review of MAs, evidence was found for associations 
of various nonocular factors with glaucoma to different degrees. However, risk 
factors were only mildly associated, suggesting low impact of systemic risk 
factors. Additional higher quality studies are needed to provide robust 
evidence.

The use of tobacco products is a major global public health issue, as it is the 
leading cause of preventable death worldwide. In addition, nicotine (NIC) is a 
key component of electronic and conventional cigarettes. Although nicotine's 
addictive potential is well known, its health effects are not entirely 
understood. Thus, the main objective of the present study was to evaluate its 
toxicological profile both in vitro, at the level of three healthy cell lines, 
and in ovo, at the level of the chorioallantoic membrane. Five different 
concentrations of nicotine were used in keratinocytes, cardiomyocytes, and 
hepatocytes for the purpose of evaluating cell viability, cell morphology, and 
its impact on nuclei. Additionally, the hen's egg test on the chorioallantoic 
membrane (HET-CAM) method was used to assess the biocompatibility and irritant 
potential of the chorioallantoic membrane. Across all cell lines studied, 
nicotine was proven to be significantly damaging to cell viability, with the 
highest concentration tested resulting in less than 2% viable cells. Moreover, 
the morphology of cells changed dramatically, with alterations in their shape 
and confluence. Nicotine-induced cell death appears to be apoptotic, based on 
its impact on the nucleus. In addition, nicotine was also found to have a very 
strong irritating effect on the chorioallantoic membrane. In conclusion, 
nicotine has an extremely strong toxicological profile, as demonstrated by the 
drastic reduction of cell viability and the induction of morphological changes 
and nuclear alterations associated with cellular apoptosis. Additionally, the 
HET-CAM method led to the observation of a strong irritating effect associated 
with nicotine.

This review summarizes the detrimental effects of cigarette and noncigarette 
emission exposure on autonomic function, with particular emphasis on the 
mechanisms of acute and chronic modulation of the sympathetic nervous system. We 
propose that the nicotine and fine particulate matter in tobacco smoke lead to 
increased sympathetic nerve activity, which becomes persistent via a positive 
feedback loop between sympathetic nerve activity and reactive oxidative species. 
Furthermore, we propose that baroreflex suppression of sympathetic activation is 
attenuated in habitual smokers; that is, the baroreflex plays a permissive role, 
allowing sympathoexcitation to occur without restraint in the setting of 
increased pressor response. This model is also applicable to other nontobacco 
cigarette emission exposures (e.g., marijuana, waterpipes [hookahs], electronic 
cigarettes, and even air pollution). Fortunately, emerging data suggest that 
baroreflex sensitivity and autonomic function may be restored after smoking 
cessation, providing further evidence in support of the health benefits of 
smoking cessation.

Tobacco smoking (i.e. cigarettes, rolled tobacco, pipes, etc.) is associated 
with significant health risks, reduced life expectancy and negative personal and 
societal economic impact. Smokers have an increased risk of cancer (i.e. lung, 
throat, bladder), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), tuberculosis and 
cardiovascular disease (i.e. stroke, heart attack). Smoking affects unborn 
babies, children and others exposed to second hand smoke. Stopping or 'quitting' 
is not easy. Nicotine is highly addictive and smoking is frequently associated 
with social activities (e.g. drinking, eating) or psychological factors (e.g. 
work pressure, concerns about body weight, anxiety or depressed mood). The 
benefits of quitting, however, are almost immediate, with a rapid lowering of 
blood pressure and heart rate, improved taste and smell, and a longer-term 
reduction in risk of cancer, heart attack and COPD. Successful quitting requires 
attention to both the factors surrounding why an individual smokes (e.g. stress, 
depression, habit, etc.) and the symptoms associated with nicotine withdrawal. 
Many smokers are not ready or willing to quit and require frequent motivational 
input outlining the benefits that would accrue. In addition to an evaluation of 
nicotine dependence, co-existent medical or psychiatric conditions and barriers 
to quitting should be identified. A tailored approach encompassing psychological 
and social support, in addition to appropriate medication to reduce nicotine 
withdrawal, is likely to provide the best chance of success. Relapse is not 
uncommon and reasons for failure should be addressed in a positive manner and 
further attempts initiated when the individual is ready.Key steps in smoking 
cessation include: (i) identifying all smokers, alerting them to the harms of 
smoking and benefits of quitting; (ii) assessing readiness to initiate an 
attempt to quit; (iii) assessing the physical and psychological dependence to 
nicotine and smoking; (iv) determining the best combination of 
counselling/support and pharmacological therapy; (v) setting a quit date and 
provide suitable resources and support; (vi) frequent follow-up as often as 
possible via text/telephone or in person; (vii) monitoring for side-effects, 
relapse and on-going cessation; and (viii) if relapse occurs, providing the 
necessary support and encourage a further attempt when appropriate.

BACKGROUND: Electronic cigarettes (ECs) are alternative-to-smoking nicotine 
delivery devices; consumers (commonly called vapers) use them in order to reduce 
or completely substitute smoking. The European Commission has released a 
proposal for a new Tobacco Product Directive that might reduce availability of 
nicotine-containing products, including ECs. In this study, the EC use patterns 
in subjects who have completely substituted smoking with EC use were examined by 
personal interviews. The study focused on nicotine levels used in order to 
achieve smoking cessation, reported benefits, associated side effects, and 
estimation of EC dependence compared with smoking.
METHODS: Participants were 111 subjects who had completely substituted smoking 
with EC use for at least 1 month. Smoking abstinence was validated by measuring 
blood carboxyhemoglobin levels. Nicotine levels at initiation of EC use, at time 
of smoking cessation, and at time of interview were recorded. Dependence 
potential was assessed by asking the first question of the Fagerström Test for 
Cigarette Dependence (time until smoking the first cigarette and until first use 
of EC in the morning) and questions about perceived past dependence on tobacco 
cigarettes and present dependence on EC.
RESULTS: Forty-two percent of participants reported quitting smoking during the 
first month of EC use. Liquids with nicotine concentration >15 mg/mL were used 
by 74% of users at initiation of EC use, while 16.2% had to increase the initial 
nicotine levels in order to achieve complete smoking abstinence. Seventy-two 
participants (64.9%) reported that from the time of smoking cessation to the 
time of the interview (8 months median duration of EC use) they reduced the 
nicotine concentration they were consuming; however, only 12% of the total 
sample was using ≤5 mg/mL nicotine concentration at the time of the interview. 
Side effects were mild and temporary. The vast majority of participants reported 
better exercise capacity and improved olfactory and gustatory senses. Perceived 
EC dependenct was significantly lower compared to smoking.
CONCLUSIONS: Nicotine levels appear to play an important role in achieving and 
maintaining smoking cessation in the group of motivated subjects studied. High 
nicotine-containing liquids were used while few mild and temporary side effects 
were reported. Proposals about regulation should consider the pragmatic use 
patterns of ECs, especially in consumers who have completely substituted 
smoking.

INTRODUCTION: Although previous studies have addressed the association between 
smoking and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), there are few studies on the 
association between electronic cigarette use and OSA. Thus, we aimed to evaluate 
the association between the dual use of electronic and conventional cigarettes 
and OSA.
METHODS: Data from 7350 participants of the 2019-2021 Korean National Health and 
Nutrition Examination Survey were analyzed in this population-based study. The 
STOP-Bang score was calculated using eight items: snoring, tiredness, observed 
apnea, high blood pressure, body mass index, age, neck circumference, and sex. 
The main independent variable was smoking behavior. A multiple logistic 
regression analysis was performed. Subgroup analysis was conducted to analyze 
the association between smoking behavior in detail and OSA, and stratified 
analyses were additionally performed.
RESULTS: Of the 7350 participants, 417 (5.7%) had a high risk of OSA, according 
to the STOP-Bang score. Compared to the non-smoker group, the dual user group 
had a 2.46-fold increase in the odds of OSA (adjusted odds ratio, AOR = 2.45; 
95% CI: 1.04-5.79). Current non-smokers who were dual users in the past had 
increased odds of having OSA (AOR=3.61; 95% CI: 1.32-9.92). In the stratified 
analyses, dual cigarette use was significantly associated with OSA in females 
and those with a low physical activity level.
CONCLUSIONS: Dual users and cigarette-only users had an increased probability of 
developing OSA. Even if they are not currently smoking or vaping, individuals 
who were dual users in the past were associated with a higher risk of OSA. The 
association between dual cigarette use and OSA was more pronounced in females 
and those with a low physical activity level. While intervening for obstructive 
sleep apnea or investigating risk factors, new smoking methods such as vaping 
and dual use should be considered along with conventional smoking.

INTRODUCTION: Although detrimental effects of combustible cigarettes (CCs) on 
the progression of lung inflammatory diseases are well known, changes in 
electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS)-exposed lung-infiltrated immune 
cells are still unrevealed.
METHODS: The analysis of blood gas parameters, descriptive and quantitative 
histology of lung tissues, determination of serum cytokines, intracellular 
staining and flow cytometry analysis of lung-infiltrated immune cells were used 
to determine the differences in the extent of lung injury and inflammation 
between mice from experimental (CC and ENDS-exposed animals) and control group 
(Air-exposed mice).
RESULTS: Continuous exposition to either CCs or ENDS induced severe systemic 
inflammatory response, increased activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in neutrophils 
and macrophages and enhanced dendritic cell-dependent activation of Th1 and Th17 
cells in the lungs. ENDS induced less severe immune response than CCs. Serum 
concentrations of inflammatory cytokines were significantly lower in the samples 
of ENDS-exposed mice. Compared to CCs, ENDS recruited lower number of 
circulating leukocytes in injured lungs and had less capacity to induce 
CD14/TLR-2-dependent activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in lung-infiltrated 
neutrophils and macrophages. ENDS-primed dendritic cells had reduced capacity 
for the generation of Th1 and Th17 cell-driven lung inflammation. Accordingly, 
extensive immune cell-driven lung injury resulted in severe respiratory 
dysfunction in CCs-exposed mice, while ENDS caused moderate respiratory 
dysfunction in experimental animals.
CONCLUSIONS: Continuous exposition to either CCs or ENDS induced immune 
cell-driven lung damage in mice. ENDS triggered immune response which was less 
potent than inflammatory response elicited by CCs and, therefore, caused less 
severe lung injury and inflammation.
IMPLICATIONS: This is the first study that compared the effects of CCs and ENDS 
on lung-infiltrated immune cells. Although both CCs and ENDS elicited systemic 
inflammatory response, immune cell-driven lung injury and inflammation were less 
severe in ENDS-exposed than in CC-exposed animals. Continuous exposition to 
ENDS-sourced aerosols was less harmful for respiratory function of experimental 
animals than CC-derived smoke.

INTRODUCTION: The EPISCAN study, published in 2007, was an update of the results 
of the 1997 IBERPOC study. Changes in demographics and exposure to risk factors 
demand the periodic update of prevalence and determining factors in COPD. This 
article is a summary of the protocol and tools used in EPISCAN II.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The primary objective of EPISCAN II is to estimate the 
prevalence of COPD among the general population aged 40 years or more in the 17 
autonomous communities of Spain. The sample size requires 600 participants (300 
men and 300 women) per center, selected by screening 10,200 participants in a 
short visit (questionnaire plus forced post-bronchodilator spirometry). Of 
these, 800 (400 with COPD and 400 without COPD) will also perform a long visit 
(including a walking test, blood tests, determination of diffusion, pulse 
oximetry and bioimpedance, and low radiation CT).
RESULTS: The first participant was recruited on 28 February 2017. As of 22 
November 2017, a total of 3,581 participants had been included, of whom 422 had 
already performed the long visit. It is estimated that the field work will be 
completed by December 2018. The new imaging data, biomarkers, and information on 
new exposures, such as electronic cigarettes and environmental pollution, will 
help us re-quantify the burden of COPD.
CONCLUSIONS: EPISCAN II will provide updated information on prevalence and 
determinants of COPD in Spain, allowing for the comparison of spirometric 
results and other factors associated with COPD among the 17 autonomous 
communities.

Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are metabolized by cytochrome P450 2B enzymes 
(CYP2B) and nicotine is reported to alter CYP2B activity in the brain and liver. 
To test the hypothesis that nicotine influences PCB disposition, 
2,2',3,5',6-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 95) and its metabolites were quantified in 
tissues of adult male Wistar rats exposed to PCB 95 (6mg/kg/d, p.o.) in the 
absence or presence of nicotine (1.0mg/kg/d of the tartrate salt, s.c.) for 7 
consecutive days. PCB 95 was enantioselectively metabolized to hydroxylated 
(OH-) PCB metabolites, resulting in a pronounced enrichment of E1-PCB 95 in all 
tissues investigated. OH-PCBs were detected in blood and liver tissue, but were 
below the detection limit in adipose, brain and muscle tissues. Co-exposure to 
nicotine did not change PCB 95 disposition. CYP2B1 mRNA and CYP2B protein were 
not detected in brain tissues but were detected in liver. Co-exposure to 
nicotine and PCB 95 increased hepatic CYP2B1 mRNA but did not change CYP2B 
protein levels relative to vehicle control animals. However, hepatic CYP2B 
protein in animals co-exposed to PCB 95 and nicotine were reduced compared to 
animals that received only nicotine. Quantification of CYP2B3, CYP3A2 and CYP1A2 
mRNA identified significant effects of nicotine and PCB 95 co-exposure on 
hepatic CYP3A2 and hippocampal CYP1A2 transcripts. Our findings suggest that 
nicotine co-exposure does not significantly influence PCB 95 disposition in the 
rat. However, these studies suggest a novel influence of PCB 95 and nicotine 
co-exposure on hepatic cytochrome P450 (P450) expression that may warrant 
further attention due to the increasing use of e-cigarettes and related 
products.

Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the leading cause of end-stage kidney disease. 
Besides glycemic and blood pressure control, environmental factors such as 
cigarette smoking (CS) adversely affect the progression of DN. The effects of CS 
on DN progression have been attributed to combustion-generated molecules without 
consideration to the role of nicotine (NIC), responsible for the addictive 
properties of both CS and electronic cigarettes (ECs). Podocytes are essential 
to preserve the structure and function of the glomerular filtration barrier, and 
strong evidence indicates that early podocyte loss promotes DN progression. We 
performed experiments in human podocytes and in a mouse model of diabetes that 
develops nephropathy resembling human DN. We determined that NIC binding to 
podocytes in concentrations achieved with CS and ECs activated NADPH oxidase, 
which sets in motion a dysfunctional molecular network integrated by 
cyclooxygenase 2, known to induce podocyte injury; downregulation of 
AMP-activated protein kinase, important for maintaining cellular energy stores 
and antioxidation; and upregulation of CD36, which increased lipid uptake and 
promoted apoptosis. In diabetic mice, NIC increased proteinuria, a recognized 
marker of chronic kidney disease progression, accompanied by reduced glomerular 
podocyte synaptopodin, a crucial stabilizer of the podocyte cytoskeleton, and 
increased fibronectin expression. This novel study critically implicates NIC 
itself as a contributor to DN progression in CS and EC users.NEW & NOTEWORTHY In 
this study, we demonstrate that nicotine increases the production of reactive 
oxygen species, increases cyclooxygenase-2 expression, and upregulates Cd36 
while inducing downregulation of AMP-activated protein kinase. In vivo nicotine 
increases proteinuria and fibronectin expression in diabetic mice. This study 
demonstrates that effects of nicotine on podocytes are responsible, at least in 
part, for the deleterious effects of smoking in the progression of chronic 
kidney disease, including diabetic nephropathy.

IMPORTANCE: Chronic bronchitis has been associated with cigarette smoking as 
well as with e-cigarette use among young adults, but the association of chronic 
bronchitis in persons without airflow obstruction or clinical asthma, described 
as nonobstructive chronic bronchitis, with respiratory health outcomes remains 
uncertain.
OBJECTIVE: To assess whether nonobstructive chronic bronchitis is associated 
with adverse respiratory health outcomes in adult ever smokers and never 
smokers.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective cohort study included 22 325 
adults without initial airflow obstruction (defined as the ratio of forced 
expiratory volume in the first second [FEV1] to forced vital capacity [FVC] of 
<0.70) or clinical asthma at baseline. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood 
Institute (NHLBI) Pooled Cohorts Study harmonized and pooled data from 9 US 
general population-based cohorts. Thus present study is based on data from 5 of 
these cohorts. Participants were enrolled from August 1971 through May 2007 and 
were followed up through December 2018.
EXPOSURES: Nonobstructive chronic bronchitis was defined by questionnaire at 
baseline as both cough and phlegm for at least 3 months for at least 2 
consecutive years.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Lung function was measured by prebronchodilator 
spirometry. Hospitalizations and deaths due to chronic lower respiratory disease 
and respiratory disease-related mortality were defined by events adjudication 
and administrative criteria. Models were stratified by smoking status and 
adjusted for anthropometric, sociodemographic, and smoking-related factors. The 
comparison group was participants without nonobstructive chronic bronchitis.
RESULTS: Among 22 325 adults included in the analysis, mean (SD) age was 53.0 
(16.3) years (range, 18.0-95.0 years), 58.2% were female, 65.9% were 
non-Hispanic white, and 49.6% were ever smokers. Among 11 082 ever smokers with 
99 869 person-years of follow-up, participants with nonobstructive chronic 
bronchitis (300 [2.7%]) had accelerated decreases in FEV1 (4.1 mL/y; 95% CI, 
2.1-6.1 mL/y) and FVC (4.7 mL/y; 95% CI, 2.2-7.2 mL/y), increased risks of 
chronic lower respiratory disease-related hospitalization or mortality (hazard 
ratio [HR], 2.2; 95% CI, 1.7-2.7), and greater respiratory disease-related (HR, 
2.0; 95% CI, 1.1-3.8) and all-cause mortality (HR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.3-1.8) 
compared with ever smokers without nonobstructive chronic bronchitis. Among 
11 243 never smokers with 120 004 person-years of follow-up, participants with 
nonobstructive chronic bronchitis (151 [1.3%]) had greater rates of chronic 
lower respiratory disease-related hospitalization or mortality (HR, 3.1; 95% CI, 
2.1-4.5) compared with never smokers without nonobstructive chronic bronchitis. 
Nonobstructive chronic bronchitis was not associated with FEV1:FVC decline or 
incident airflow obstruction. The presence of at least 1 of the component 
symptoms of nonobstructive chronic bronchitis (ie, chronic cough or phlegm), 
which was common in both ever smokers (11.0%) and never smokers (6.7%), was 
associated with adverse respiratory health outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings suggest that nonobstructive chronic 
bronchitis is associated with adverse respiratory health outcomes, particularly 
in ever smokers, and may be a high-risk phenotype suitable for risk 
stratification and targeted therapies.
